Recently, several key figures appear to have struck an agreement with [noble_ally_target.GetName] to advocate a pro-[noble_ally_target.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] course of action in return for certain favors and promises.

Fortunately, some members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] have offered generous gifts in return for only a few government offices. These sales would bring in a lot of revenue, but, in the long term, more officials could mean more tax revenue siphoned off before it reaches our treasury."

A proposal has recently reached [target_ruler.GetName]'s ears to grant several families of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] export licenses for our trade with [trade_target.GetName]. Doing so would please them greatly, but the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] may view the matter less favorably."

 random_event.29.title: "Non-Enforcement of Ordinances"
 random_event.29.desc: "Although [target_ruler.GetName] issues many ordinances, [target_ruler.GetHeSheFormal] is, in practice, almost powerless to enforce them. Instead, enforcement depends upon the local powers - regional [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] and city governments - that are not always as vigilant as we desire.
