  winter_events.4.title: "Cold and Wet Fields"
  winter_events.4.desc: "The frost has been upon us for quite some time. The harvest seems ever-shrinking in the eyes of the local peasantry as the many granaries run out of produce at an alarming rate. The latest victim to an outbreak of famine is [target_province_1.GetName]. As summer shortens, grains in need of sunlight fail to produce the same volume as prior years. It would be wise to attempt and alleviate the situation, lest we risk misfortune and disease spread uncontrollably!"
  winter_events.4.a: "Such is the price we pay for life."
  winter_events.4.b: "We can at least compensate the local farmers!"

  winter_events.5.title: "Floating Ice"
  winter_events.5.desc: "The spread of winter and lower temperatures have affected the vital passages that ships use to ferry goods to and from [ShowProvinceDefinitionName('icelandic_coast_province')]. The progress of the ice seems to be ever-expanding and the entire island is seemingly besieged by walls of white.\n\nThe fishermen and whalers who usually cross these waters report that the icebergs around the island no longer retreat with the arrival of spring, making the area dangerous to cross all year round."
  winter_events.5.historical_info: "During the #italic Little Ice Age#!, Iceland's coastlines often became choked with drifting sea ice, especially from the 17th century onwards. This ice, swept down from the Arctic, would often linger well into summer, cutting off vital fishing and trade routes.\n\nWith supply ships blocked, the island faced prolonged periods of isolation and hardship, struggling through food shortages and economic strain. The sea did not freeze over entirely, but the ice made Iceland's already tough existence even more difficult during those colder centuries."
  winter_events.5.a: "A fortress of frost!"

  winter_events.6.title: "[ShowAreaNameWithNoTooltip('greenland_area')] in a Standstill"
  winter_events.6.desc: "The typical winter in [ShowAreaName('greenland_area')] is one of much snow and fight for survival. Ever since the beginning of the great frost, the landscape has transformed into an almost uninhabitable frozen expanse. Glaciers, like frozen giants, stand tall around the entire island, blocking access to and from its few ports for most of the year.\n\nThe few settlements across the island's southern coast now dwindle as intensified winters make farming and raising livestock nearly impossible."
  winter_events.6.historical_info: "Even the Inuit, adapted to cold climates, found the deeper freezes and unpredictable weather challenging. Greenland became a land where survival meant constant battle against the encroaching cold and isolation."
  winter_events.6.a: "Let us hope for warmer times..."

  winter_events.7.title: "Dead Pastures in [ShowAreaNameWithNoTooltip('greenland_area')]"
  winter_events.7.desc: "Centuries ago, the brave seamen and settlers who first set foot on [ShowAreaName('greenland_area')] brought with them sheep and goats. These animals grazed across the pastures of the southern coast of the island, where the climate, while cold, still allowed for pastoral farming. The settlers used [ShowGoodsName('wool')] to make clothing, blankets, and other essential items to survive in the harsh environment.\n\nHowever, the last few winters have made it impossible to maintain a proper stock. As the fields freeze, our once sustainable livestock output is now all but gone. At the same time, the schools of fishes that once filled our banks seem to lessen with every season. Life seems colorless and bleak during the cold winters in [ShowAreaNameWithNoTooltip('greenland_area')]."
  winter_events.7.historical_info: "During the #italic Little Ice Age#!, colder temperatures, as well as shorter growing shorter growing seasons and harsher winters, made it increasingly difficult to sustain livestock. Pastures that once supported sheep and goats began to shrink under the encroaching ice and permafrost, leading to a decline in [ShowGoodsNameWithNoTooltip('wool')] production. At the same time, the ice made it harder to sustain the local fishing output, resulting in extensive starvation and a sharp decrease in food stockpiles."
  winter_events.7.a: "A tragedy to be sure."

  winter_events.8.title: "Drought in [target_province_1.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
  winter_events.8.desc: "The recent climate shifts have not favored our people. The lack of rain and the constant frosts have destabilized the entire ecosystem in [target_province_1.GetName], resulting in spells of drought. This is but the most recent hurdle in decades of turbulent winters, many crops have failed and famine is a frequent occurrence.\n\nThe locals are understandably distraught, many demand reparations in an effort to safeguard themselves and their families from hunger and untimely death."

  winter_events.9.desc: "The migrating patterns of [ShowGoodsName('livestock')] have become quite stagnant in the last few years. The lack of available grazing fields and the ever-falling temperature has made it extremely difficult to maintain our pastoral grounds.\n\nThis, in turn, has led to a severely decreased output in that sector, one that many of our people depend on. We know not when this wave of frost and ice will recede, but we can hope and pray for the best possible outcome against all odds."

Farmers that once sold innumerable sacks worth of produce, now starve and watch their farmsteads wither away.\n\nMany have suggested the shifting of their farms to accommodate for the growing of cheaper food alternatives in an effort to combat starvation, especially around the fields in [target_location.GetName].

From late December 1708 through March 1709, temperatures dropped dramatically, covering the land in snow and ice for weeks.
