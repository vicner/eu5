 institution_events.1.desc: "The rule of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has been a simple one for centuries.

 institution_events.3.title: "Growing Influence of the Urban Gentry"
 institution_events.3.desc: "While they lack a formal voice in our government, the rich urban centers have many other ways of making their influence known. In some cases, urban centers can even band together to further bolster their power over a province. The leaders of one such conglomeration have recently met in [urban_location.GetName] and are now approaching us to ask that we formalize the methods they use to exert authority over our provinces. Allying with the urban centers would allow us to promote much more durable systems of governance, but we would likely lose the support of the local [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] we currently rely on for military support."

 institution_events.40.desc: "The acts of lending money and offering loans are permitted in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGroup.GetAdjective] faiths; making an unethical profit from loans through interests, on the other hand, is very much forbidden. As such, many [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGroup.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] merchants, guilds, and royals have to rely on Jews and other moneylenders who do not have to follow such rules.\n\nHowever, religious condemning does not stop profit-seeking merchant families from establishing moneylending businesses.

Naturally, cunning men striving for wealth and power seize the opportunity to create businesses and banks.\n\nA banking family in [banking_location.GetName] in particular has risen to fame as they have proven quite successful in their craft.

 institution_events.51.desc: "With [professional_armies_country.GetName]'s introduction of a professional, standing army, the demand of weapons and armor has increased significantly. This development not only affects the [professional_armies_country.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] markets, but our own too as [professional_armies_country.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] merchants scour for blades for their [professional_armies_country.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] and [professional_armies_country.GetGovernment.GetRulerOrRegent.GetHerHis] growing military."
