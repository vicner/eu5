 mercantilism_events.1.title: "Importing Food to Combat Famine"
 mercantilism_events.1.desc: "The recent food shortages in parts of our nation have caused many among the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] to question those trade policies which prevent the importing of vital goods. People are calling for trade barriers to be relaxed, hoping that the crisis can be mitigated by buying food from more fortunate nations."
 mercantilism_events.1.a: "In this time of need, lives matter more than politics."
 mercantilism_events.1.b: "We must strive to be self-sufficient, even when we are not."
 mercantilism_events.2.title: "Imports Compete with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] Quality Goods"
 mercantilism_events.2.desc: "Our neighbors have established a large colonial presence in the New World. The exports from this distant land have been steadily increasing, and some of the more exotic goods have become hot commodities, even among those who should know better than to be dazzled by curiosities.\n\nRecently, our neighbors have taken this a step further, openly fueling this interest. By encouraging people to 'buy American', they are pushing for more imports from the colonies, outcompeting our own goods and depriving good [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people of work. We might profit from this influx of foreign trade, but the safest option would be to erect barriers to reduce it."
 mercantilism_events.2.a: "Let us see what the colonies have to offer."
 opinion_pleased: "Pleased"
 mercantilism_events.2.b: "Nothing of decent quality could come from those backwater upstarts."
 opinion_insulted: "Insulted"
 mercantilism_events.3.title: "Importing Iron"
 mercantilism_events.3.desc: "We strive to keep the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] military strong, modern, and domestically supported, but sometimes our priorities conflict with each other. Lacking the rich iron mines of our neighbors, some of our grander plans for future military development will not be possible as soon as we might wish. Increasing imports is a tempting solution, but relying on foreign support might compromise our trade policies. Then again, a knife in our neighbor's back would be all the more brilliantly insidious if it were made from their own steel..."
 mercantilism_events.3.a: "We need imported iron for our military."
 mercantilism_events.3.b: "We must rely on our own resources. Heart matters more than iron."
 mercantilism_events.4.title: "Importing Naval Supplies"
 mercantilism_events.4.desc: "Ambitions to improve our nation's navy have recently stalled. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] shipbuilders lack neither ideas nor plans, but supplies. Some of them cannot help but rather vocally note how our neighbor has an abundance of materials that would be useful in equipping a modern navy. We try not to make our fleet dependent on foreign support, but if this policy stands in the way of progress, perhaps we could import just enough materials to test new shipbuilding techniques."
 mercantilism_events.4.a: "We can compromise if doing so puts some plans in motion."
 mercantilism_events.4.b: "Ships from foreign wood? It would be safer to fashion them from rock!"
 mercantilism_events.5.title: "Controversial Protectionist"
 mercantilism_events.5.desc: "Since our advisors started influencing the trade developments in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], internal trade has been strengthened at the cost of curtailed imports and increased state regulation. While the advisors' decisions to improve infrastructure have been appreciated, recent suggestions have caused many influential people to question their philosophy. Detractors argue that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] is taking their advisors' advice too readily, and that we should look for mutually beneficial deals with other nations, rather than seeking to dominate every area of trade."
 mercantilism_events.5.a: "Their methods have helped us so far."
 mercantilism_events.5.b: "An administration should facilitate free trade, not restrict it."
 mercantilism_events.6.title: "Radical Reforms"
 mercantilism_events.6.desc: "Some of our most trusted advisors have been conversing a lot in private recently. Plotting, some say; drafting plans for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s future, others say. Whatever they are discussing, it is clearly controversial enough to warrant some secrecy.\n\nAt last, they have finally approached the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] to present the results of their conferences. The thick stack of papers they offer contains plans for radical changes to the nation's trade practices, including increased protectionism, additional regulation, and altered industrial policy."
 mercantilism_events.6.a: "This is radical to simpler minds, perhaps, but not for our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
 mercantilism_events.6.b: "Are they suggesting that our current policies are not effective?"
 mercantilism_events.7.title: "Intercolonial Trade"
 mercantilism_events.7.desc: "Establishing colonial subjects overseas has allowed us to expand our trade while remaining in control, importing goods from lands that are essentially under [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] rule. As long as we supply our colonies with what they need, they have no reason to start putting gold in the hands of our enemies.\n\nSadly, the settlers sometimes have a different opinion from our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] on what exactly it is they 'need.' They have thus begun to trade with neighboring colonies and natives, circumventing trade barriers we established to protect our nation's interests. This clearly benefits the settlers, but whether it benefits us is highly doubtful."
 mercantilism_events.7.a: "They are subjects of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip]. Our interests override theirs."
 mercantilism_events.7.b: "They are part of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip]. What is in their best interests benefits us too."
 mercantilism_events.8.title: "Chocolate Imports"
 mercantilism_events.8.desc: "Prominent economists have been analyzing the rapid increases in chocolate imports to our nation recently. Ever since one of our neighbors came to control a large quantity of the world's known cocoa supply through deft trade practices, their confectionery has grown very popular even among [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] people. Protectionist politicians are now questioning whether such imports of luxury goods benefit [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], arguing that growing dependent on a good which our neighbors control leads to gold flowing out of our nation."
 mercantilism_events.8.a: "But a river of sweet, sweet chocolate is flowing into our nation."
 mercantilism_events.8.b: "Restrict imports of this sinful indulgence."
 mercantilism_events.9.title: "Coffee Imports"
 mercantilism_events.9.desc: "Prominent economists have been analyzing the rapid increases in coffee imports to our nation recently. Ever since one of our neighbors came to control a large quantity of the world's known coffee bean supply through deft trade practices, their beverages have grown very popular even among [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people. Protectionist politicians are now questioning whether such imports of luxury goods benefit [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], arguing that growing dependent on a good which our neighbors control weakens our economic position."
 mercantilism_events.9.a: "Do these so-called economists have to deal with early mornings?"
 mercantilism_events.9.b: "We must limit the spread of this unnatural narcotic."
 mercantilism_events.9.c: "We [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] are a tea-drinking people. We will have none of this."
 mercantilism_events.10.title: "Tea Imports"
 mercantilism_events.10.desc: "Prominent economists have been analyzing the rapid increases in tea imports to our nation recently. Ever since one of our neighbors came to control a large quantity of the world's known tea supply through deft trade practices, their beverages have grown very popular even among [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] people. Protectionist politicians are now questioning whether such imports of luxury goods benefit [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], arguing that growing dependent on a good which our neighbors control weakens our economic position."
 mercantilism_events.10.a: "If we discard tea, civilization will swiftly follow."
 mercantilism_events.10.b: "We should dump their tea into the ocean!"
