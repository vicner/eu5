 privateers.1.title: "Local Traders Demand Aid"
 privateers.1.desc: "Merchants and captains of trade vessels in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have sent a representative to the government, describing their home as increasingly lawless land, where piracy runs rampant and ships and ports are routinely raided by privateers. They argue that the government has neglected them and request funding to build defenses against the growing threats. If this request is not granted, many feel like they have already lost too much and will take their business elsewhere."
 privateers.1.a: "Send them whatever they need."
 privateers.1.b: "They have enough money to fund those defenses themselves."
 refused_aid_traders: "Refused to aid Traders"
 privateers.2.title: "Invalid Letter of Marque?"
 privateers.2.desc: "Privateering is always a difficult diplomatic issue, especially when no open war is conducted, and the distinction between an enemy who must be subject to certain rules of war and a lawless pirate is not always clear-cut. Even less so in the case of a recently captured vessel, which has displayed a letter of marque issued by a [privateer_country.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] with dubious authority.\n\nWhile this supposed privateer looks like a simple pirate to us, accepting the letter as valid may allow us to maintain better diplomacy with his masters."
 privateers.2.a: "This flimsy excuse cannot be allowed to spare him from the gallows!"
 privateers.2.b: "We can afford to show some lenience in this rare case."
 privateers.3.title: "Invalid Letter of Marque?"
 privateers.3.desc: "Pirates are a constant scourge of our merchants, and successfully detaining them is usually a great victory not only for us, but for our trade partners as well. Our most recent capture of a supposed pirate, on the other hand, has turned into a diplomatic incident, as he claims to have been raiding ships on behalf of one of our own subjects.\n\nThe captain has presented a letter of marque issued in the name of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], but by a [privateer_country.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]. Supposedly, any aggression against us was a tragic misunderstanding. Desperately trying to avoid the gallows, the captain implores us to settle the matter with the governor."
 privateers.3.a: "The governor overstepped his authority. This pirate will hang."
 privateers.3.b: "A letter issued in our name is valid, even from a subject."
 privateers.4.title: "A Reckless Privateer"
 privateers.4.desc: "Enlisting the aid of privateers to wreck the trade efforts of our adversaries has proven beneficial to us, but also tends to attract unreliable and devious business partners. One captain has become notorious for skirting the rules and ignoring treaties our privateers are supposed to abide by, but also happens to be very efficient in raiding enemy ships.\n\nPerhaps these two traits are connected, perhaps not. Regardless, revoking the captain's letter of marque would be the diplomatically safe option, but would lose us our best privateer."
 privateers.4.a: "Laws and treaties are more like guidelines, anyway..."
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_reckless_privateer: "Reckless Privateer"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_reckless_privateer: "A ruthless privateer was allowed free rein, leading to other privateers attempting bolder raids."
 privateers.4.b: "We will not tolerate outlaws in our employ!"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_curtailed_privateer: "Curtailed Privateer"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_curtailed_privateer: "A ruthless privateer was removed from our service, causing other privateers to be more careful in their methods."
 privateers.5.title: "Privateer Captain Goes Rogue"
 privateers.5.desc: "There is a very fine line between privateering and piracy, especially in peacetime. The captain and crew of one of our privateering operations recently waltzed across that line when they decided to attack and plunder one of our own traders. Worse yet, we have been informed that this act of open defiance was only the beginning of their exploits, and that these traitors have now set out to make their own fortune... primarily, it seems, out of our fortune."
 privateers.5.a: "We'll have their heads for this!"
 privateers.6.title: "Oceans Beyond Privateering"
 privateers.6.desc: "One of our most accomplished privateers is making forays not only into enemy waters, but into parts of the world we were barely aware were under their control. His skills as a navigator could be put to better use if we provided the funds for a longer expedition to discover just how far the hand of the enemy reaches, perhaps even reaching further, claiming new lands for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] in the name of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetName] faith."
 privateers.6.a: "Let him lead the way. Our ships shall encircle the world."
 privateers.6.b: "Privateers should look for money from our enemies, not from us."
 privateers.7.title: "Pirates Seeking Allegiance"
 privateers.7.desc: "Our use of privateering to strengthen our position on the oceans has not gone unnoticed by the unsavory individuals who raid ships without the blessing of a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]. While we prefer not to see many similarities between our legitimate authorizations of reprisal and these pests, some of them see quite a few.\n\nSome of the more successful pirates in our area of interest are seeking to receive the backing of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is more or less official capacity. They are also suggesting, through crude insinuations, that if we do not take them up on the offer, someone else just might."
 privateers.7.a: "We could use some ruthless seafarers in our employ."
 privateers.7.b: "This is extortion. We will not do business with pirates."
 privateers.8.title: "Pirates Seeking Allegiance"
 privateers.8.desc: "A group of pirates recently approached one of our privateers, requesting [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] support in their efforts to plunder and pillage. Of course, once they have our backing, our own ships would be safe from them. "
 privateers.8.a: "They can count themselves among our privateers."
 privateers.8.b: "We reject this scourge of honest traders."
 privateers.9.title: "Captured Slavers"
 privateers.9.desc: "One of our privateers has captured a ship containing what its owners considered cargo, but what we consider people: Slaves. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has outlawed the abhorrent practice of slavery, but other nations are not so enlightened.\n\nThe slaves have gained their freedom, but there is still some discussion about what to do with those who transported them. Showing lenience and treating them as traders, although operating under a different flag and legislation, would be the diplomatic option. However, our laws and moral sensibilities suggest that slavers should always be viewed as pirates and kidnappers and dealt with accordingly."
 privateers.9.a: "Those who trade in human lives are pirates and nothing more."
 privateers.9.b: "We'll let them go for now."
 privateers.10.title: "Plausible Deniability"
 privateers.10.desc: "Conducting any form of attacks on rival ships in peacetime, whether through sanctioning reprisals or private wars or covertly backing piracy, has had many benefits to us, but is not without problems. One of our privateering operations was recently compromised and the ships and crew captured. As luck would have it, they had lost their letter of marque, proving they work with our approval, and whatever proof connects them to us is purely circumstantial.\n\nAs a last resort, the captain has now contacted us, hoping we will admit to our official backing so it can be used as leverage in the upcoming trial."
 privateers.10.a: "These are legitimate merchants retaliating against foreign aggressions!"
 opinion_angry: "Angry"
 privateers.10.b: "We've never seen these marauders before. They look like rogue pirates to me."
