 industrialization_events.1.title: "The Atmospheric Engine"
 industrialization_events.1.desc: "Although the use of steam as power for a moving engine is known since ancient antiquity, recent developments are harnessing it for more practical applications. Building on older experimental air pumps, [target_scientist.GetName] has created in [invention_province.GetName] a new type of engine that uses steam pressure to move a cylinder and pump water out of wet mines. The atmospheric engine now enables mining where it was previously not possible and its adoption will greatly increase the efficiency of mines in our country."
 industrialization_events.1.a: "We can smell the airs of progress."

 industrialization_events.2.title: "Steam Powered Blast"
 industrialization_events.2.desc: "Although the [ShowAdvanceName('coke_blast_furnace')] was a great improvement in the metallurgy process, the impurities of coke make it cause usually more problems than benefits. Recently, some studies have been made in [invention_province.GetName] to solve these issues, and the use of steam engines to blast air into the furnace has showed great potential. Although many of our brightest minds agree that there is still much room for improvements, these new techniques have already greatly improved our metallurgy processes."
 industrialization_events.2.a: "It is a blast into the future."

 industrialization_events.3.title: "Improved Steam Engine"
 industrialization_events.3.desc: "Improving upon the design for earlier atmospheric engines, the entrepreneur and inventor [target_scientist.GetName] has managed to create in [invention_province.GetName] a new type of machine that makes use of a separate condenser and a rotary motion instead of the oscillating one of previous engines. Operating at just above the atmospheric pressure, the [target_scientist.GetLastNameWithNoTooltip] Steam Engine promises to be twice as productive as earlier models and will prove invaluable as a means to drive machinery in all types of industrial enterprises."
 industrialization_events.3.a: "The perfect engine to propel us forward."

 industrialization_events.4.title: "Self-Sharpening Plows"
 industrialization_events.4.desc: "The [ShowAdvanceName('rotherham_plough')] improved a key tool for agriculture that had remained basically unchanged since the times of the Roman Empire. Now, plows can be lighter and cause less burden on the animals pulling them. This new model has not only spread all over our country, but has also sparked the interest for finding ways of improving tools, no matter how established their designs are.\n\nAlready, improvements have been made in [invention_province.GetName], where through the process of putting into contact molten and cool metal, a process called chilled casting, plows become so sharp that they are called to be self-sharpening."
 industrialization_events.4.a: "This will cleave new paths for our economy."

 industrialization_events.5.title: "The Flying Shuttle"
 industrialization_events.5.desc: "[target_scientist.GetName], a local inventor working in [invention_province.GetName], has patented a new design for a 'wheeled' shuttle that [target_scientist.GetSheHe] promises will revolutionize weaving by eliminating the need for a second person to catch the shuttle as it passes through the warp threads. Although productivity is still limited by the rate at which thread can be spun, this new model of shuttle is quickly spreading to weavers all over the country, already improving a major bottleneck in textile production"
 industrialization_events.5.a: "Productivity will rise to the sky."

 industrialization_events.6.title: "Spinning Jenny"
 industrialization_events.6.desc: "A major limitation for weaving productivity has long been the rate at which thread can be spun. Even before the introduction of the flying shuttle, one weaver required four spinners to service the loom. To overcome this hurdle, [target_scientist.GetName], has devised in [invention_province.GetName] a machine allowing one worker to do the work of many spinners. Together with the flying shuttle, this machine promises to greatly improve the efficiency of weaving in the near future."
 industrialization_events.6.a: "The threads of our fate look golden."

 industrialization_events.7.title: "The Flow of Goods"
 industrialization_events.7.desc: "Recent advances and inventions have allowed us to greatly improve our productivity. However, no matter how much people produce, it will not return into actual benefits if goods are not allowed to flow sufficiently due to inadequate infrastructure. In [industrial_province.GetName], some people have already begun to take initiative to maintain and expand themselves the road network, and they have even started to introduce toll roads to pay for such improvements and maintenance. There are also far gone plans of building potential transportation canals and specialized roads to further ease the local flow of goods."

 industrialization_events.17.title: "Hostility to New Production Techniques"
 industrialization_events.17.desc: "The changes in production methods that technological progress has brought have not been welcomed by everyone.
