 corruption_event.1.title: "The Honest Merchants of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 corruption_event.1.desc: "While many traders are known for lying about the quality of their goods and making fraudulent promises to foreigners and countrymen alike, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] merchants are well known to be trustworthy, if competitive. Although our merchants may sometimes cut deals that benefit themselves and not their trade partners, they rarely lie or take bribes. This has made [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] the first choice of traders around the world."
 corruption_event.1.a: "Why would we lie when we have the best offers?"
 corruption_event.2.title: "Trust Your Neighbor"
 corruption_event.2.desc: "Although citizens are encouraged to act in good faith during their exchanges, the reality in many nations is that trusting others is a risk that many people cannot afford to take. This, however, is not the case in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\nWe have successfully stamped out corruption on so many levels in society that our people not only trust officials to do their jobs (without the extra help of a bribe), but they also trust each other more in day to day exchanges. Belief in the honesty of others is the very thread from which the fabric of society is woven, and our country is a shining example of it."
 corruption_event.2.a: "This is stipulated in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] teachings."
 corruption_event.3.title: "Rigorous Researchers"
 corruption_event.3.desc: "Academic institutions are not immune to corruption, and the profits that might be made by abusing positions of great influence can stand in the way of creating an environment conducive to research. However, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] scientists are largely above this, prioritizing genuine intellectual achievement above titles and financial gain. The lack of corruption in our society thus allows us to explore and invent without being impeded by selfish interests."
 corruption_event.3.a: "The pursuit of knowledge must be valued in itself."
 corruption_event.4.title: "An Honorable People"
 corruption_event.4.desc: "Few are the countries in the world that do not claim to value honor and justice, but even fewer are those countries that actually live up to these ideals. However, the lack of both large-scale and everyday corruption in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has made it one of these rare places where principles take precedence over personal gain. Even abroad, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] expatriates are sought after for positions of trust, as our people are known for their adherence to duty and rejection of attempted bribes. Who else can claim to live up to these principles?"
 corruption_event.4.a: "Few indeed."
 corruption_event.5.title: "Incorruptible"
 corruption_event.5.desc: "Not everyone who aids the enemy knows the true extent of their own transgressions. Spies may be loyal to foreign powers, but many of their informants are people who are simply paid well for telling secrets that they should not, with no understanding of who makes use of them or how. That being said, in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], corruption has been all but extinguished. Spies who recently tried to compromise our administration through bribery and extortion have found themselves reported instead of aided by our officials, and are now at our mercy."
 corruption_event.5.a: "Death to spies!"
 corruption_event.6.title: "Corrupt Taxmen"
 corruption_event.6.desc: "Those who handle large sums of money have always been tempted to claim more than their fair share of it, and tax collectors are no exception. However, while we can afford some money being 'lost' along the way, affluent citizens have recently found that they can avoid some taxes altogether by paying large bribes to taxmen instead. Currently, this scheme seems to be supported by some of the older collectors who are trying to retire comfortably. While tacitly allowing this practice is costly, we might be able to avoid spending time and effort on a detailed investigation and instead just wait it out."
 corruption_event.6.a: "Investigate and replace the corrupt tax collectors immediately."
 corruption_event.6.b: "Let them retire. They have served us well in the past."
 corruption_event.7.title: "Corrupt Advisor"
 corruption_event.7.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] may be plagued by corruption, but we try to ensure that those closest to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] can be trusted, at the very least. Well, try and fail, it seems, since one of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName]'s advisors, [SCOPE.sCharacter('minister').GetName], was recently caught taking large bribes from people who already wield great influence in our country, inclining [SCOPE.sCharacter('minister').GetHerHim] toward providing the government with advice that is slanted to advance the interests of the rich and powerful."
 corruption_event.7.a: "We shall publicly expose these lies and prepare an execution."
 corruption_event.7.b: "We can arrange for a quiet retirement in house arrest."
 corruption_event.7.c: "Reprimand the advisor. Biased advice is still advice." 
 corruption_event.8.title: "Wily Smugglers"
 corruption_event.8.desc: "Smuggling is an activity that even the most simple-minded can decide to pursue. The only difference between a clever smuggler and a bad one is that the latter gets caught. The more worrisome ones are those with a genuine talent for knowing whom to bribe and what lies to tell so that they can evade capture. Unfortunately, as smuggling grows more profitable, the numbers of such men tend to swell.\n\nWe have been on the trail of a particularly wily band of smugglers recently, and the web of deceit that they have managed to weave in order to maintain their operations continues to surprise us."
 corruption_event.8.a: "Assign our best men to track down their collaborators."
 corruption_event.8.b: "Send an agent to recruit them as spies."
 corruption_event.8.c: "Ignore them for the time being."
 corruption_event.9.title: "The [SCOPE.sLocation('culture_location').GetDominantCulture.GetNameWithNoTooltip] Community Distrusts Us"
 corruption_event.9.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] may not house the most egregious liars and traitors in the world, but compared to some other countries, our people do tend to be a bit more easily bribed into abusing their authority. Most of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] population accepts the difficulties and, to the dishonest, the occasional benefits that this brings.\n\nThe [SCOPE.sLocation('culture_location').GetDominantCulture.GetName] people in [SCOPE.sLocation('culture_location').GetName] see things differently, however. They lament this state of affairs as a consequence of letting the easily corrupted [ROOT.GetCulture.GetName] people rule the nation, claiming that the country ruled by their own people does not suffer the same criminality. Some of them are suggesting that they would be better off seceding."
 corruption_event.9.a: "Apologize for our failure and promise to improve."
 corruption_event.9.b: "Reject these claims as uneducated prejudice."
 corruption_event.10.title: "Corrupt Ambassadors"
 corruption_event.10.desc: "Our representatives to other countries should embody the very best of our people, but, unfortunately, this is not always the case. Sometimes, officials are given posts as ambassadors because the administration wants them far away, and, on occasion, there is good reason for this.\n\nAs it turns out, some ambassadors have spent their well-paid exile further enriching themselves with bribes. While this has not exactly been improving our reputation with the locals, these ambassadors have maintained important connections here at home and will not be dismissed without causing some problems."
 corruption_event.10.a: "These ambassadors have caused too much trouble. Get rid of them."
 corruption_event.10.b: "The locals shall have to get used to it."
 corrupt_ambassador: "Corrupt Ambassadors"
 corruption_event.11.title: "[SCOPE.sLocation('trade_goods_location').GetRawMaterial.GetNameWithNoTooltip] 'Disappearing'"
 corruption_event.11.desc: "With corruption ever on the rise in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], an increasing amount of [SCOPE.sLocation('trade_goods_location').GetRawMaterial.GetName] has been disappearing from our legitimate trade networks onto the black market. While some blame excessively restrictive regulations and tariffs, part of the problem is that these crimes are simply too easy to get away with. When silence is easily bought, secrets are easy to keep, and those secrets are growing more and more costly for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 corruption_event.11.a: "We must regain control of the [SCOPE.sLocation('trade_goods_location').GetRawMaterial.GetNameWithNoTooltip] market."
 corruption_event.12.title: "Corrupt Generals"
 corruption_event.12.desc: "Military experience and expertise should be the main, if not only, factors influencing who rises through the ranks of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] army. As our society grew more and more corrupt, however, our promotion practices crept further and further away from this ideal.\n\nThe reality of today is that a position as a general carries a lot of prestige. Those with money or connections are more than willing to leverage both to secure such a post, and they can do so because the existing leadership is easily influenced by such methods. From time to time, someone may rise through the ranks who has actually earned their title, but, otherwise, many of our finest strategic minds will never have a chance to lend us their skills."
 corruption_event.12.a: "Such an unjust world..."
 corruption_event.13.title: "Corrupt Admirals"
 corruption_event.13.desc: "Those who command our ships in battle and those who are sent by the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] to explore and claim new lands should be chosen from the bravest and wisest in our navy. This is not the case in today's world. From their very first day on a ship, sailors see money illicitly changing hands, with protocol being broken as a matter of course. Sailors quickly learn that both the letter and the spirit of the law carry little weight in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] when silver is put on the other pan of the scales. Those who do not learn quickly make enemies.\n\nTo advance through the ranks of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] navy, one needs to learn to play the system, and those who rise to the top are rarely those who we would wish to see there."
 corruption_event.13.a: "No wonder we have mutinies."
 corruption_event.14.title: "Foreign Merchants Distrust Us"
 corruption_event.14.desc: "Every administration tries to cut deals that will be to its benefit, and many are willing to bend the truth a little to achieve their goals. While this is to be expected, merchants from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have a reputation abroad that stretches into the realm of outright lies and fraud. The corruption which has become a part of how we conduct business can be shocking to outsiders, which has led to traders worldwide choosing to avoid us when possible.\n\nIt is too late to do anything about our present image, as the damage has already been done, but perhaps we can stop this from reoccurring if we stamp out the casual corruption in our society."
 corruption_event.14.a: "We're not dishonest, just pragmatic!"
 corruption_event.15.title: "Governmental Functions Breaking Down"
 corruption_event.15.desc: "A corrupt administration operates less to sustain itself and more to enrich its members. Consequently, as a government begins to fall apart, the immediate reaction of many officials is not to save what they all stand to lose, but to grab what they can while it lasts.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] may not be on the brink of a complete collapse, but the severe corruption reaching all the way from the lowest clerk to those closest to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has corroded several crucial governmental functions, leading to a widespread destabilization of the country. This has been a long time coming, and we will all pay the price."
 corruption_event.15.a: "This cannot be allowed to continue."
 corruption_event.16.title: "Mercenaries Extorting Locals"
 corruption_event.16.desc: "During wartime, soldiers of fortune often find ways to make it home with a bit more than what they are paid by raiding the lands where they are sent to fight. Normally, this is not a problem for us, when they are sent abroad to terrorize our enemies, but sometimes this habit is hard to break, even during peacetime. Some farmers and travelers in [SCOPE.sLocation('hired_mercs_victim_area').GetProvince.GetName] have complained that the [hired_merc_band.GetName], a mercenary band in our employ stationed there, has been robbing and extorting them, despite - or perhaps because of - the fact that there is not even a war being waged.\n\nMeddling in the ranks of mercenaries, even ones that we have hired, is always a difficult matter. Their accusers are unlikely to take the matter further if we let it slide, but the question remains as to how our society will change if we allow such extortion to continue."
 corruption_event.16.a: "Purge the mercenary ranks of such thugs."
 corruption_event.16.b: "This is part of the price our country pays for their service."
 corruption_event.17.title: "Corrupt, But Competent Administrator"
 corruption_event.17.desc: "Matters of governmental organization have never been [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName]'s strong suit. A good leader compensates for such shortcomings by delegating, and this is exactly what our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has done. However, the people who have handled administration in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerHis] stead have proven to be more competent than honest. The government runs well enough, but it is slowly shifting its priorities toward matters which the benefactors of such irreplaceable officials find important.\n\nWith [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerselfHimself] unable to fully grasp the intricacies of the matters in question, the guilty parties cannot easily be discerned or removed from office. For now, we shall simply have to suffer the consequences of their actions."
 corruption_event.17.a: "It is unfortunate that skill and honor do not always go hand in hand."
 corruption_event.18.title: "Overextension Exploited"
 corruption_event.18.desc: "The rapid expansion of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] borders is most fortunate, but brings with it new administrative challenges. As everyone familiar with optimistic euphemisms knows, 'challenges' is the sweeter-tasting word for 'problems.' Our country has yet to fully adjust to its new reach, and less scrupulous people who have noticed both the confusion and the poorly enforced laws in these new acquisitions are reaping the benefits.\n\nThis lawlessness may eventually pass, but our current administrative trials appear to be building an unstable foundation for the future. It will take time and money to rid our society of the distrust forming as a result of the present situation."
 corruption_event.18.a: "We will have to adapt as best we can."
 corruption_event.19.title: "Corrupt Connections"
 corruption_event.19.desc: "We try to keep our administration free of dishonest individuals, but we cannot always account for the friends and contacts which got our officials to where they are. [target_ruler.GetName] has unfortunately turned out to be a good example of the problems that can arise from this, as [target_ruler.GetSheHe] is skilled and personable, but somewhat gullible in [target_ruler.GetHerHis] choice of associates.\n\nRecent investigations have revealed that much of our well-built trade network has relied on bribes, smuggling, and other dubious activities to reach its current level of efficiency. [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] claims to have known nothing of this, which is likely true. Nevertheless, if we decide to expose and end this practice, the responsibility will be [target_ruler.GetHersHis]."
 corruption_event.19.a: "Failure to see through lies is still a failure."
 corruption_event.19.b: "If it works, leave well enough alone."
 corruption_event.20.title: "Bribes Growing More Accepted"
 corruption_event.20.desc: "'What is the difference between an honest man and a fool? The fool does not know that he is being swindled.'\n\nThis is an increasingly common saying in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], the spirit of which is being proven through a more sinister change in our social fabric. Bribes are beginning to be seen as a natural consequence of the market, where every transaction carries a price. Those who refuse to take bribes are viewed as fools, as the saying suggests, or worse. The consequence of this cynicism is that any form of power corrupts, and no one who believes likewise is immune, not even the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]."
 corruption_event.20.a: "It is just a saying."
