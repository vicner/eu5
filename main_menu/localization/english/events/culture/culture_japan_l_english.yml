 culture_japan.1.title: "O-Ie Sōdō"
 culture_japan.1.desc: "Recently, the disputes between different [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] families have been increasingly fierce, up to the point even of having resulted in deaths among them. If they continue, they may pose a serious threat to the stability of the political system, and should therefore be taken very seriously.\n\nSo ingrained have these feuds become in the culture, that people are already starting to refer to it as 'the house strife', or #italic O-Ie Sōdō#!. As long as it does not directly involve them, people see these conflicts as just a regular occurrence, and even as a somewhat form of entertainment in itself.\n\nNow, it appears [target_character.GetName] [target_character.GetHerselfHimself] has become involved in one of these disputes, and the people are demanding [target_character.GetHerHis] head on a plate."
 culture_japan.1.a: "[target_character.GetSheHe|U] should have known better!"
 culture_japan.1.b: "Refuse to comply with their demands."
 
 culture_japan.2.title: "Unruly [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')]"
 culture_japan.2.desc: "The prevailing peace of past few years has left many in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] caste without active work to perform. These idle hands have now turned instead to exploiting and oppressing the local [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] population. They will need to be dealt with."
 culture_japan.2.a: "It is just how they keep their fighting skills sharp."
 culture_japan.2.b: "They will be punished severely."

 culture_japan.3.title: "Heirless"
 culture_japan.3.desc: "Since [target_ruler.GetName] has been unable to provide our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] with a suitable [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle], speculation over the future course of the nation is running rampant. These debates threaten to undermine our position. [target_ruler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] could adopt [target_character.GetName] as [target_ruler.GetHerHis] own [target_character.GetDaughterSon] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle], but doing so might be perceived as a sign of weakness."
 culture_japan.3.a: "Strength in solace."
 culture_japan.3.b: "Adopt and legitimize [target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 
 culture_japan.4.title: "Losing Face"
 culture_japan.4.desc: "The relative instability of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] has led others to begin questioning our ability to maintain national cohesion. [target_character.GetName] has seen [target_character.GetHerHis] leadership and general management skills constantly being put into question. Admitting that the situation is somewhat out of our control will be a severe blow to our authority and influence."
 culture_japan.4.a: "Admit that the situation is not stellar."
 culture_japan.4.b: "Insist that everything is fine!"

 culture_japan.5.title: "Lacquerware For the [target_emperor.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]"
 culture_japan.5.desc: "A beautiful lacquerware chest in our study has caught the eyes of an imperial retainer, and word of this fantastic artifact has spread to the imperial court, and the [target_emperor.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] [target_emperor_character.GetHerselfHimself]. There seems to have developed a quiet understanding between ourselves and the [target_emperor.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] that this chest be presented as a gift to [target_emperor_character.GetHerHim] from [target_emperor_character.GetHerHis] most loyal subject."
 culture_japan.5.a: "Naturally the chest shall be a gift for [target_emperor_character.GetHimHerFormal]!"
 culture_japan.5.b: "Unfortunately, we cannot afford such gifts."

 culture_japan.6.title: "The First Sake"
 culture_japan.6.desc: "The first Sake of the season is ready, and the traditional tasting is only a few weeks away. The question is whether we should invite the [target_boss.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] for a celebratory first tasting, or if we should try to leverage our position in the marketplace and sell early instead."
 culture_japan.6.a: "We are in dire need of favor with the [target_boss.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]."
 culture_japan.6.b: "Let us get this batch on the market!"
 culture_japan.6.c: "It will be a divine offering."
 
 culture_japan.7.title: "Exceptional Swords"
 culture_japan.7.desc: "A new smith has produced a shipment of swords of unparalleled quality for our troops. We can either equip our own forces with them, or use the opportunity to sell them and make a large profit. Swords like these are likely to be in great demand with our neighbors..."
 culture_japan.7.a: "Our army always has first claim on equipment."
 culture_japan.7.b: "We require money above all else!"

 culture_japan.8.title: "Attempted Coup!"
 culture_japan.8.desc: "It would seem the political climate in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] is not as stable as it was thought. Traveling across the country, [target_ruler.GetName] was resting at a temple near [target_ruler.GetHerHis] forces when the army's general saw an opportunity and surrounded the temple complex with [target_character.GetHerHis] own forces, claiming that 'the enemy was inside'. Only the swift and decisive action of loyalist troops led to the timely rescue of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] and the traitor's capture.\n\nThe general's motives are unclear, and [target_character.GetSheHe] could well have been motivated by anything, from a desire for revenge to a blatant lust for power. The incident has reaffirmed [target_ruler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]'s control over the troops, but the brief skirmish that erupted has cost the lives of many good men, and it is clear that a renewed focus will be required on internal politics to ensure that this does not occur again."
 culture_japan.8.a: "There shall be no mercy for this dishonorable act!"
 culture_japan.8.b: "Ambition should actually be rewarded, not punished."
 
 culture_japan.9.title: "$jap_jokamachi$ Spread"
 culture_japan.9.desc: "Our neighboring [target_neighbor.GetName] have begun building new forts, which they surround with #italic $jap_jokamachi$#!, 'Castle Towns' emerging around it. These are settled by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] with no separation between the social groups and no regular allotment, ensuring that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] can maintain tight control over the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] class.\n\nThe other classes, combined with the establishment of free markets and open guilds, stimulate merchandise and trade, and therefore prosperity. The $jap_jokamachi$ thereby could become a means for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] to increase control both in the military and economic spheres, while at the same time increasing the wealth of the domain."
 culture_japan.9.a: "We should encourage the development of these castle towns."
 culture_japan.9.b: "We have more important things to focus on."
  
 culture_japan.10.title: "Rise of Urban Culture"
 culture_japan.10.desc: "With the increase of the urban population, the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have shown an increased interest in cultural activities. As such, many of those are flourishing, like the Kabuki theater, the art of singing and dancing; and the Ukiyo-e, woodblock prints or woodcuts and paintings featuring motifs of landscapes, tales from history, the theater, and pleasure quarters. Perhaps the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] should show some interest in Kabuki theater or the Ukiyo-e too."
 culture_japan.10.a: "It would help them to understand the people better."
 culture_japan.10.b: "What could they possibly want with this?"
 
 culture_japan.11.title: "The Za"
 culture_japan.11.desc: "There have always been guilds, or #italic Za#!, in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName], where merchants cooperate with temples and shrines in order to protect themselves against bandits, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')], and warlords. The merchants that pertain to those guilds can then organize themselves in groups for travel and transport their goods more safely. They have also arrangements that allow them to sell their goods inside temple grounds, giving them the protection of the temple itself.\n\nSome [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip] feel that these benefits are not enough and they have turned to [target_character.GetName], offering a share of profits in exchange of protection, some tax exemptions, and other formal governmental benefits."
 culture_japan.11.a: "It sounds like a great deal."
 culture_japan.11.b: "This does not interest us at the moment."
 
 culture_japan.12.title: "Growing Power of the Za"
 culture_japan.12.desc: "The Za, the trade guilds in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName], are becoming increasingly bigger and more organized, to the point that they are able to protect their activities independently. As such, they are influential enough to affect general market prices and there is the risk for them to dominate some of the trades obtaining a monopoly on them. There have been some voices claiming for measures to be taken to curtail their influence, lest we risk having all our economy falling into their hands."
 culture_japan.12.a: "Curtail the privileges of the Za."
 culture_japan.12.b: "Keep it as it is."
 
 culture_japan.13.title: "$jap_jokamachi$"
 culture_japan.13.desc: "In an increasingly hostile world, the safety of a castle is both a promise of protection and employment. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] have for years been abandoning their countryside homes for the settlements beneath the walls of the castles of their masters, along with merchants and craftsmen. Our capital, [target_location.GetName], is no exception and its growth has been a source of concern to our administrators.\n\nNew funds will likely be required to improve the infrastructure if we want to minimize problems such as fire and disease."
 culture_japan.13.a: "They will have what they require."
 culture_japan.13.b: "Impose restrictions on who can move into [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."

 culture_japan.14.title: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('peasants_estate')] Migrate to [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 culture_japan.14.desc: "As population increases in the countryside, the size of the plots of land under each farmer has been decreasing with each inheritance. While yields have been increasing, some farmers are still unable to live off their land. Many have come to live in the capital instead, furthering the growth pains of [target_location.GetName].\n\nLandholders are complaining and implore us to impose more social order. They strongly suggest we enforce laws to hinder the movement of people within our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
 culture_japan.14.a: "Decree that no man may move without permission."
 culture_japan.14.b: "We cannot stop the growth of the cities."

 culture_japan.15.title: "Trade Monopolies"
 culture_japan.15.desc: "The growth of cities has led to the ancient Za trade guilds of our country to rapidly increase their power. The generally chaotic situation in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] has also meant that they increasingly rely on their own arrangements for security. The guilds have now tied temples, landholders, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] to their cause. But they have also gained enemies.\n\nSome implore our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] to take a stand against the guilds and open up the economy for anyone of ability. Others argue that we should at least give out monopolies and privileges to others than the guilds."
 culture_japan.15.a: "We will abolish the old regulations that feed them!"
 culture_japan.15.b: "Monopolies work well but we should not grant them based on tradition."
 culture_japan.15.c: "We must protect the arrangements of our ancestors."

 culture_japan.16.title: "Wakō"
 culture_japan.16.desc: "The Wakō, pirates originating from various of the many islands around the coasts of [ShowRegionName('japan_region')], have become rampant in the region, raiding the shores of both [ShowSubContinentName('east_asia')] and [ShowRegionName('korea_region')] as well as our own. Despite this, the difficulties of trade with $china$ mean that these pirates are our only source of [ShowCultureGroupName('chinese_group')] and [ShowCultureName('korean_culture')] goods. The increasing frequency of pirate attacks means that we can no longer remain passive. We must take a decision on how to deal with them."
 culture_japan.16.a: "Fund the pirates."
 culture_japan.16.b: "Crack down on piracy."

 culture_japan.17.title: "The Wakō Pirates and the Bahan Trade"
 culture_japan.17.desc: "In times of uncertainty, the fishermen and seafarers of these lands have often resorted to piracy and raiding the coasts of our neighbors. The profits they could get from performing honest trade are usually not as big as what they can get from simple pillaging and raiding, and 'Bahan Trade' has started being used to refer to these pirate raids.\n\nTimes and balance of power are prone to change, however, and the Bahan Trade has once again become an increasingly common occupation among our subjects. Some lords have themselves started to either fund or actively partake in the raids. Meanwhile, the victims of these Wakō pirates have begun to offer titles and honors to those that help stop the menace."
 culture_japan.17.a: "We must make use of them!"
 culture_japan.17.b: "We must stop these raids!"
 wako_raids: "Wakō Raids"

 culture_japan.18.title: "Reactions to the Wakō"
 culture_japan.18.desc: "Piracy and raiding has continued to increase. The participants range from simple fishermen and minor lords to those living on the foreign coastlines themselves. Over time, powerful interests, at home as well as abroad, have begun to patronize successful pirate chiefs, and it seems pirate strongholds now litter our islands and coasts.\n\nNow neighboring states have begun to take much harsher action. They are preparing for the arrival of the raiders and actively hunt down pirate leaders. [target_ruler.GetName] [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] has received clear threats from foreign envoys that unless we act forcefully, they will consider our vessels enemies and presume that they are among the pirates."
 culture_japan.18.a: "It is not something that concerns us."
 culture_japan.18.a.tt: "All known [countries|e] within [trade_range|e] get [ShowBiasValue('opinion_pirate_supporters')|+=0] [opinion|e] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 culture_japan.18.b: "Let us help protect the foreign countries."
 culture_japan.18.b.tt: "All known [countries|e] within [trade_range|e] get [ShowBiasValue('opinion_pirate_fighting')|+=0] [opinion|e] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

 culture_japan.19.title: "Pirate Stronghold in [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 culture_japan.19.desc: "Lords in [target_location.GetName] have become known as fearless corsairs, and the loyalty and wealth they command has afforded them great influence and power. There, a particularly successful pirate leader by the name of [target_character.GetName] has built a stronghold sustained entirely by [target_character.GetHerHis] expeditions. Taking down such a fortress would likely come at a high cost, but [target_character.GetSheHe] is making a mockery out of our own naval ambitions."
 culture_japan.19.a: "What do we care if [target_character.GetSheHe] lives off the wealth of foreigners?"
 culture_japan.19.b: "Perhaps [target_character.GetSheHe] could be made a servant of our state..."
 culture_japan.19.c: "We must pull out these weeds of decay from our garden!"

 culture_japan.20.title: "The Question of Residence"
 culture_japan.20.desc: "[target_character.GetName] has sent word that the [target_character.GetSheHe] requires our presence near the capital, in accordance to the policy of [ShowPolicyName('sankin_kotai_policy')]. Residing in our own [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] all year will not be acceptable, and our family must instead reside in [target_country.GetCapital.GetName] all year. While this has at times already been the case, this [target_country.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] order leaves little room for us to decide for ourselves. [target_own_ruler.GetName] must travel to the [target_country.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] [target_country.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] at once or face dire consequences."
 culture_japan.20.a: "By all means let us do so."
 culture_japan.20.b: "The [target_country.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip] is weak and weak willed."

 culture_japan.21.title: "A New Dynasty Rises"
 culture_japan.21.desc: "With the rise to power of [new_ruler.GetName], the power of the old [old_ruler.GetDynasty.GetName] has come to an end. This will mark a new era for our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], in which even our identity may be questioned. In the end, can we really be called the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] without the [old_ruler.GetDynasty.GetNameWithNoTooltip] dynasty?"
 culture_japan.21.a: "The rise of a new [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
 culture_japan.21.b: "Actually, [old_ruler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] adopted [new_ruler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] in [old_ruler.GetHerHis] will."

 culture_japan.22.title: "Heads and Turned Tail"
 culture_japan.22.desc: "To be rewarded for their deeds in battle, our warriors put for display the decapitated heads of the enemies they have fallen. The more impressive the head is, the better the reward. We have been waging war like this for generations, but there are always people who want to exploit it. Heads of lower soldiers or even local peasants presented as higher ranking officials, heads from people they have not actually killed, or any other kind of subterfuge serves to increase their apparent deeds.\n\nOne such dubious behavior appears to be circulating around [target_character.GetName], as in a recent encounter [target_character.GetSheHe] left the fighting before it was finished due to [target_character.GetHerHim] already being satisfied with the amount of heads taken. Of course, this is not uncommon, as many prefer a smaller reward over risking their life and thus leave the battle once satisfied with their prizes. However, the rumors around [target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip] accuse [target_character.GetHerHim] of having done so due to fear of the enemy rather than being satisfied with the heads taken, and they even cast some doubts about the authenticity of those heads."
 culture_japan.22.a: "Running from the battle, a shameful display!"
 culture_japan.22.b: "[target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip] is a [target_character.GetWomanMan] of honor."

 culture_japan.1000.title: "Cadastral Survey"
 culture_japan.1000.desc: "After going through some turbulent times, our authority over the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('japanese_shogunate').GetName] is not as strong as we would like. To remediate this, we could organize national cadastral surveys, to account for all people and resources of our clans, as well as what are their internal ties and alliances. This would allow us to reassign lands and titles if needed, to make them more equal among each other, and all of them subservient to us. Of course, such an endeavor would be very costly, and not particularly popular among them."
 culture_japan.1000.a: "It is absolutely needed."
 culture_japan.1000.a.tt: "All [members|e] of the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('japanese_shogunate').GetName] will react to this."

 culture_japan.1001.desc: "In an attempt to increase [target_ruler.GetHerHis] authority over the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('japanese_shogunate').GetName], [target_ruler.GetName] has been conducting nation-wide cadastral surveys. This involves measuring and counting all people, resources, and ownership relations, and refashioning them according to [target_ruler.GetHerHis] design. It is a task that comes with [target_ruler.GetHerHis] office, but it is being used to turn long-standing relationships of power on their heads.\n\nToday, the time for such a survey has come for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName]. We have been approached by the envoys of the [target_country.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] administration with a proclamation stating that fiefs granted to vassals ultimately belong to the state, and that vassals hold land in trust for the present time only."
 culture_japan.1001.a: "Nobody will touch my right to collect tax!"
 culture_japan.1001.b: "Welcome the [target_country.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] administrators."

 culture_japan.1100.title: "Appointment to [target_shogunate.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] Office"
 culture_japan.1100.desc: "We have many clans serving our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. Their leaders are always people of ambition, constantly struggling among themselves for power and preference. Their duty is nonetheless to serve us, and some perform it more diligent than others. There is currently a vacancy in our administration, and we could grant this title to one of the clans, giving them a great honor but also tying them further to our interests. We may even be able to use this as a way to limit their influence."
 culture_japan.1100.a: "Let us offer it to the [target_clan_1.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip]."
 culture_japan.1100.b: "The [target_clan_2.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip] will do a good job."

Given the sincerity of the request, a refusal would be out of the question, and could even be seen as a sign of outright rebellion and dishonor. It is also clearly a way to achieve prestige and influence for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], but it is a dangerous honor. The [target_shogunate.GetFlavorRank] has lately been going through officials at an alarming rate. Not content to allow their supporters and loyal retainers to hold high office, they are now dismissing those that do not deliver the results that the [target_shogunate.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] expects. To some, this is a system of merit, but to the many officials in [target_shogunate.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] service, it means a constant fear of scrutiny."

 culture_japan.1205.desc: "The [target_shogunate.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip] have grown bolder in their hubris, as they have threatened us to fulfill our duty to answer their summons, at the risk of rousing their ire. If we do not comply, they may use this as an excuse to brand us as traitors."
 culture_japan.1205.a: "Very well, send them help."

 culture_japan.1207.desc: "The [target_clan.GetLongName] blatantly refuse to answer our summons and have denied us their aid.

Their gall is unprecedented, but it is true that our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] is not as strong as we would like. Maybe some leniencies now may avoid us some extra trouble in the future."
