Such was its gravity, that Diokletianus proudly declared it the capital city of Rome's eastern region. Later on, its barracks would host crusaders and Ġuzāt alike, when its ownership passed from the former to the latter during the early 13th century. It was finally captured by besieging Ottoman troops in 1337."
 rise_of_the_ottomans.201.historical_info: "Known for its rich history and serving as the first capital of the Ottoman Empire, Bursa boasts a beautifully-weaved historical tapestry. Within its domain, it holds architectural marvels such as the Yeşil Türbe and the Grand Mosque, testaments to an illustrious history." 
 rise_of_the_ottomans.202.historical_info: "Flourishing as a cultural and political hub under the Seljuk regime, Konya has served as the birthplace of many civilizations.

 rise_of_the_ottomans.203.historical_info: "Throughout its history, Ankara has been the scene of numerous battles as armies vied for control. During the Roman era, the city flourished as a hub of culture, trade, and the arts. Later, under Ottoman rule, it became a crucial point on the eastern caravan trade routes. Ankara served as the seat of power of a republic-like merchant brotherhood during the 14th century, an interesting oddity within a region of warring Beyliks." 
 rise_of_the_ottomans.204.historical_info: "Hailing from the days of Hittite times, Kayseri has served as a vital point of the famous Silk Road. During ancient times, the city served as the seat of Cappadocian kings, and under Persian rule it witnessed the sweeping might of Alexander 'the Great'. The city experienced three golden ages: as a trade post between the Assyrians and Hittites around 2000 BCE, during Roman rule from the 1st to 11th centuries, and under the Seljuks from 1178 to 1243. Despite its turbulent history of sieges and battles, the city proudly displays an air of architectural sophistication, serving as the host of landmarks such as the Hunad Hatun Külliyesi and the Kilij Arslan mosque."

In recent centuries, it was ravaged by besieging Turk armies until it was rebuilt by one of Nicea's emperors, John III Doukas Vatatzes, in 1222. Smyrna became the target of a crusade spearheaded by the Knights of Rhodes and the Kingdom of Cyprus in 1344, resulting in a victory that saw the city passing into the hands of Rhodesian crusaders. It was here that in 1403 the Knights Hospitallers would suffer a crushing defeat at the hands of Timur, resulting in the great conqueror inflicting great damage upon the city. Despite this, the city's Greek influence was still strong enough for the Ottomans to dub the city 'Smyrna of the infidels'."

It facilitated the exchange of goods like tea and carpets and played a key role in Sultan Kaykhusraw II's 1243 campaign, culminating in the Battle of Köse Dağ. The construction of the Çobandede Bridge near Erzurum in 1289 further enhanced its importance, solidifying Erzurum as a hub of commerce and logistics.

While Islamic traditions often discouraged depictions of living beings, these coins reflected a blend of cultural influences and political symbolism. The lion and sun may have represented celestial connections, such as the constellation Leo, or symbolized the union of a powerful ruler and his consort. Beyond their artistic value, these coins were tools of economic control, circulating widely to reinforce the authority of the Seljuk Sultanate.
