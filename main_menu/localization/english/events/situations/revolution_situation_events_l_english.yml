 the_revolution.1.title: "The [target_of_rev_scope.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] Revolution"
 the_revolution.1.desc.a: "Driven by widespread discontent against the monarchy, economic hardship and social inequality, our people have finally undone their shackles and taken power in their own hands. The spread of new ideas and literacy have culminated in a radical change within our society.\n\nThe once powerful nobles that held power now cower behind their palaces of greed and dispair, as we take arms against tyranny and monarchy at home and abroad."
 the_revolution.1.desc.b: "In an unprecedented turn of events, the people of [target_of_rev_scope.GetName] have seeemingly usurped the power from their masters, effectively weakening centuries-old institutions. Such a move will certainly send ripples across the halls of the entire continent, and may yet shake the foundation of the world's most powerful monarchs. We are witnessing history in the making!"
 the_revolution.1.historical_info: "In 1789, the Revolution began in France. Fueled by widespread discontent against the monarchy, a low standard of living, and a rigid class system, the situation was only worsened by costly wars and royal extravagance, leading to rising bread prices and famine.\n\nEnlightenment ideas promoting liberty and equality further ignited unrest, and, in 1789, the Estates-General convened, where the Third Estate formed the National Assembly, challenging the monarchy. This eventually led to the storming of the Bastille, a symbol of popular defiance.\n\nSoon after, the #italic Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen#! followed, proclaiming liberty, equality, and fraternity as central principles of the Revolution."
 the_revolution.1.a: "Onwards to spread the ideals of the Revolution!"
 the_revolution.1.b: "Interesting times are ahead of us."

Clothes in tatters, beaten and bloody, [target_character.GetSheHe] protests that not once were the ideals of the Revolution betrayed under [target_character.GetHerHim]. But of course, a pig squeals the loudest closer to slaughter. We will see what cause this traitor will bleed for!"
 the_revolution.2.desc.b: "Suspected of revolutionary sentiment for quite some time, [target_character.GetName] is apprehended at the orders of [target_ruler.GetName] in suspicion of steering hate and propaganda against central authority.

Now it has become a symbol of the Revolution itself as its enemies are executed via the guillotine en masse."
 the_revolution.7.historical_info: "In fact, the guillotine was invented and constructed by Antoine Louis - the court surgeon and physiologist of King Louis XVI himself - and the German engineer Tobias Schmidt.

Whether through the clashing of arms, the intervention of foreign powers, or the collapse of revolutionary leadership, the dream of a new society has been crushed beneath the boots of tradition and authority. The streets once filled with cries for freedom now lie silent, and the old institutions reassert their dominance. The scars of this conflict will linger, and the people will not soon forget."
