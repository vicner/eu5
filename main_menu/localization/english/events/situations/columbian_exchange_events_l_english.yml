Any of that could prove very profitable back at home if introduced to our people appropriately."
 columbian_exchange.1.historical_info: "The Columbian Exchange was a historical event that took place in the 15th and 16th centuries, when the Old World and the New World came into contact for the first time. This period was marked by the exchange of people, plants, animals, and ideas between the two hemispheres, leading to significant changes in both continents.\n\nIn Europe, the arrival of new crops such as maize, potatoes, and tomatoes helped to feed a growing population, while tobacco and cocoa became popular commodities. Meanwhile, the introduction of new diseases in the Americas had a devastating effect on the Indigenous population, who had no immunity to illnesses like smallpox and influenza."
