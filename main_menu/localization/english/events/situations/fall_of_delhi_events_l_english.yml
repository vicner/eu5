Since then, vast swathes of lands in $india$ have fallen to our might. However, as time moves on, we have lost the favor of our people. Those we once bestowed graces and governorships on have now become snakes in the grass, biding their time and deciphering the tale of our destruction.\n\nAhead of us lies a turbulent and dangerous path. The survival of our great [GetCountry('DLH').GetFlavorRank] hangs in the balance between destruction and utter domination. A storm is coming..."

Ahead of us lies a difficult choice. We could bolster our courage and stand against the invaders of [GetCountry('DLH').GetName]. Such a move would certainly displease them and risk facing their wrath. However, many of our advisors believe that the giant has slowed down and become decayed, victory has eluded them and thus they ardently support the idea of opposing such a force in the hopes that we manage to expand our domain."

  delhi_situation.3.desc: "Alas, years of decay, mismanagement, and the overextension of our royal power have led to this moment. Inadvertently and with dark desires, those who wish to prey on our lands have stepped forth from the shadows, and proclaimed their intentions. The next few decades will surely be filled with peril as only our faith and prowess will see us through.\n\nNevertheless, we are a proud people whose legacy is the conquest of a vast domain, one which our history has likely never seen.

  delhi_situation.7.title: "Opposers' Interference"
  delhi_situation.7.desc: "Our legendary conquests across $india$ have amassed us a great number of [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('dharmic')] subjects and enemies.

Roaming brigands that masquerade as members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] have taken to openly criticize and oppose our administrative decisions on the local level.
