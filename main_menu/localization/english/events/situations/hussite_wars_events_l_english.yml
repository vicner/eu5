The wars pitted radical Hussite factions against Catholic loyalists and crusading armies sent by the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope. Despite being outnumbered, the Hussites used innovative tactics and internal unity to repeatedly defeat their enemies, forcing the Church to eventually negotiate and grant limited concessions."
