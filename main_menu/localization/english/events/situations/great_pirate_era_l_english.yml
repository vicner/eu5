 great_pirate_era.1.desc: "[target_location.GetName] has fallen victim to rampant piracy! The local cutthroats have gone as far as to proclaim the [target_country.GetLongName]. Emboldened by the absence of lawful authority in the island, they have seized the fort and declared a republic of pirates.\n\nAt the helm is the notorious pirate captain [target_character.GetName] and [target_character2.GetName], whose fragile hold over the island's band of outlaws is constantly tested by their ruthless lieutenants, eager to exploit any sign of weakness.\n\nThis so-called republic is not only a breach of our sovereignty over the [ShowProvinceDefinitionName('bahamas_province')] but a direct challenge to the order and values of all civilized nations. Chaos now rules in [target_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."

 great_pirate_era.1.historical_info: "New Providence, an island in the Bahamas, became a notorious pirate haven in the early 18th century. After the fall of British control, pirates like Blackbeard and Charles Vane turned it into a base for raiding Caribbean trade routes. For a time, New Providence was a chaotic pirate republic, defying European powers until the British reasserted control in 1718 under Governor Woodes Rogers, ending its golden age."

 great_pirate_era.2.title: "The Founding of [target_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 great_pirate_era.2.desc: "An unlikely alliance between the pirate captains [target_character.GetLastName] and [target_character2.GetLastName] has united the pirates of [ShowRegionName('madagascar_region')] into a single community. Naming their republic [target_country.GetName], the pirates follow a utopian doctrine of radical liberty and communalism.\n\nThey reject slavery and statecraft, governing through majority voting and recruiting liberated slaves from nearby ports to strengthen their ranks. While this ragtag republic is sure to attract the anger of [ShowContinentName('europe')]'s colonial powers, whose merchant ships they target, these idealists will attempt to flourish against the odds."
 great_pirate_era.2.historical_info: "Libertalia, a legendary pirate colony, was said to be founded by Captain James Misson in Madagascar during the late 17th century. It was envisioned as a utopia of radical liberty, where pirates rejected slavery and state rule, governing through democratic means. Though most historians consider Libertalia more myth than fact, its ideals of freedom and communalism remain a powerful symbol of resistance to authoritarianism."

 great_pirate_era.3.desc: "The zealous displacement of minorities faithful to [ShowReligionGroupName('muslim')] across [ShowRegionName('iberia_region')] now includes converts suspected of secretly maintaining their old faith. This has brought forth new people to our lands, and one of the wealthy families that recently arrived has done so under threat of persecution in their former home. Settling in [target_location.GetName], they have abandoned their old lives for high seas piracy, joining forces with piratical slavers.\n\nThe newly formed [target_country.GetName] is led by [target_character.GetName], a recent convert from [ShowLocationName('the_hague')]. This development is undoubtedly a side-effect of the flourishing pirate era!"
 great_pirate_era.3.historical_info: "The Republic of Salé, established in the early 17th century on the Moroccan coast, was led by renegade pirates, including the Dutchman Jan Janszoon, who adopted the name Murat Reis after converting to Islam. It became a notorious base for Barbary corsairs, who raided European ships and coastal towns. Salé thrived as a pirate republic for several decades, with its leadership drawn from a mix of Moroccan elites and foreign renegades, before it was absorbed into local Moroccan rule."

 great_pirate_era.4.desc: "The [target_country.GetLongName], ally of the [ShowCultureName('turkish_culture')] corsairs in the [ShowLocationName('bay_algiers')], is a powerful figure in the [ShowAreaName('western_mediterranean_sea_area')].\n\nThese hardened seadogs often receive foreign and local support, as they operate in a disruptive manner against foreign merchants, seizing their cargo and sailors. Pawns of politics and diplomacy, their privateering abilities are a powerful asset against any adversary."
 great_pirate_era.4.historical_info: "The Tetouan pirates were active in the 16th and 17th centuries, based in the Moroccan city of Tetouan. Founded by Andalusian refugees, or Moriscos, expelled from Spain, they mainly targeted Spanish and Portuguese ships in the Mediterranean.\n\nThese pirates were part of the larger Barbary piracy along North Africa, raiding vessels and capturing slaves for local markets. They were sometimes supported by local rulers and the Ottoman Empire, making them a significant threat to European trade. Eventually, European naval forces, especially the Spanish, took action to suppress their activities."

 great_pirate_era.5.title: "Pirates in [target_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 great_pirate_era.5.desc: "Several letters of marque have been issued to enterprising privateers in the [ShowRegionName('caribbean_region')], aiming to disrupt rival commerce and shipping. Many of these privateers have established themselves in [target_country.GetName] in [target_location.GetName], where they have found ample opportunities for plunder.\n\nLocal authorities, willing to deal in stolen goods, have also attracted pirates who operate without a letter of marque or allegiance to any sovereign. This growing lawlessness has tempted more and more privateers to abandon their commissions and turn to piracy themselves. Rumors suggest that [target_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip] has become a pirate haven, a '#italic Sodom of the New World#!'."
 great_pirate_era.5.historical_info: "In the mid-17th century, following the English conquest of Jamaica from Spain in 1655, the pirates of Port Royal began to rise. Located on Jamaica's southern coast, Port Royal quickly became a refuge for pirates, privateers, and buccaneers, largely because of its strategic position in the Caribbean and the lenient governance that prevailed there. To protect the colony and weaken Spanish influence, the English government supported privateers by granting letters of marque, authorizing them to raid Spanish ships and settlements. Notable figures like Henry Morgan played a key role in transforming Port Royal into a renowned hub for pirate activities. By the late 1600s, the town was notorious for its wealth, vice, and lawlessness, earning a reputation as a pirate haven. However, Port Royal's prominence ended after a catastrophic earthquake in 1692."

 great_pirate_era.6.historical_info: "In the 17th century, Tortuga, a small island off the northwest coast of Haiti, emerged as a prominent pirate haven, especially during the 1650s and 1660s. Its strategic location attracted pirates and privateers who targeted Spanish shipping and evaded colonial authorities while plundering lucrative trade routes.\n\nThe Brethren of the Coast was an alliance formed among these pirates, uniting various crews under a shared code of conduct known as the Pirate Code of the Brethren. This code established rules for behavior, loot distribution, and conflict resolution, fostering a sense of camaraderie among the seafarers.\n\nNotable figures like Henry Morgan and Bartholomew Roberts exemplified the Brethren's daring exploits against Spanish settlements and treasure fleets. The activities of the Brethren contributed to the legendary image of piracy in the Caribbean, making Tortuga a pivotal center for such endeavors."

Yet here we are, sails still catching wind, the banner of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] still flying high. Merchants still whisper our names in fear, and navies still scramble to contain us. The so-called powers of the world failed to snuff us out, and in their failure, we have carved our legend across the waves of the seven seas.

However, the fires of this wretched movement still burn bright across the ports of the [target_pirate_country.GetLongName].\n\nFor decades, they consolidated their power under [target_character.GetName] and [target_character.GetHerHis] predecessors, reaching the top of their pyramid of greed, thriving in the loot accumulated from their many voyages. Their ships are faster, their sailors hardened, and their captains bolder than ever. Trade convoys reroute in fear, coastal settlements reinforce their walls, and the navies of the world brace for more blood. The [target_pirate_country.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] have prevailed."

 great_pirate_era.200.desc: "For decades, the scourge of piracy has haunted the coasts, infesting the trade routes that often ferry vital and valuable goods. Thankfully, due to collaborative efforts, the last pirate havens have been razed and their leaders await a swift appointment with the hangman.\n\nThe so-called crews of renegade fortune now bow before crowns, or lie rotting in shallow graves.

 great_pirate_era.300.desc: "The seas churn with the chaos of shifting powers, crumbling trade monopolies, and restless ambition. As the powers of [ShowContinentName('europe')] wage endless war for dominance, their merchant fleets grow fat and complacent — easy prey for bold men with sharp cutlasses and swifter ships.\n\nIn the furthest corners of colonial outposts and lawless harbors, a new breed of seafarer emerges. Castaways, privateers, deserters, and dreamers drawn by fortune and freedom now gather under black flags. These outlaws turn to piracy not just for plunder, but for purpose.\n\nFrom the humid coves of the [ShowRegionName('caribbean_region')] to the stormy waters of [ShowContinentName('africa')], whispers spread of a rising tide of piracy, an age not of kings or crowns, but of sails, steel, and rum. A golden age of plundering, booze, and seafaring adventures."
 great_pirate_era.300.historical_info: "The Golden Age of Piracy lasted from the mid-1600s to the early 1700s. It began as rival empires expanded across the seas, using privateers to attack enemy trade. When peace came, many of these men refused to give up the profits and freedom of raiding, turning to piracy.\n\nNavies were stretched thin, and many coasts remained poorly defended. In places like the Caribbean and West Africa, pirates found safe harbors and eager recruits. Ships were often crewed by former sailors, escaped slaves, and outcasts, forming communities that rejected the rules of kings and merchants.\n\nFigures such as Henry Morgan, Blackbeard, and Bartholomew Roberts became legends of the era. Though eventually crushed by coordinated naval campaigns, their reign marked one of the most daring and lawless chapters in maritime history."
