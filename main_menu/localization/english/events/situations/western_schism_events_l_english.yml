 western_schism.4.historical_info: "Jan Hus, also known as Johannes Hus, was a theologian and philosopher who became one of the first reformers of Catholicism. He was the inspiration for the Hussite faith, a predecessor to Lutheranism. He was born to poor parents but was trained for priesthood in an attempt to escape poverty. Serving as a priest, he opposed many aspects of the Catholic Church in Bohemia. When Alexander V was elected Pope he issued a papal bull to excommunicate him and during the Council of Konstanz, when the Western Schism ended, Jan Hus attended to present his views on the dissension with the Church but was immediately arrested and put in prison. He refused to recant his view, and on July 6th, 1415, he was burned at the stake for heresy. His followers formed a new religion and fought against five different crusades during the next few decades. The Hussite faith lasted for almost two centuries in Bohemia."
