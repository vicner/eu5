 black_death.1.desc: "Disturbing news has reached us from [GetDisease('bubonic_plague').GetOrigin.GetName], as we recently received the following report from there.\n\nAlas! our ships enter the port, but of a thousand sailors hardly ten are spared. We reach our homes; our kindred and our neighbors come from all parts to visit us. Woe to us for we cast at them the darts of death! Whilst we spoke to them, whilst they embraced us and kissed us, we scattered the poison from our lips. Going back to their homes, they in turn soon infected their whole families, who in three days succumbed, and were buried in one common grave. Priests and doctors visiting the sick returned from their duties ill, and soon were numbered with the dead. O death! cruel, bitter, impious death! which thus breaks the bonds of affection and divides father and mother, brother and sister, husband and wife. Lamenting our misery, we feared to fly, yet we dared not remain."

Generally, they are a positive force for society, providing the public with confidence in products, ensuring the market remains stable, and controlling the growth of competition, among other things. Now that plague has seeped into our nation, spreading throughout the land, it is more important than ever that guilds ensure that prices remain stable and work continues to be supplied.\n\nHowever, to ensure this, guilds have been controlling wages, keeping them as they have always been in spite of the labor shortage caused by the death around us. Many guild members have become greatly disgruntled, knowing that they could be earning more, but would be crushed by the guild if they went independent.
