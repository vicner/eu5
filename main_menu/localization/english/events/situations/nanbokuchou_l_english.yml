 nanbokuchou.1.desc.common: "Times of uncertainty are upon us as the Imperial line is divided. Both [target_koumyou.GetName] of the [GetCountry('NTC').GetAdjective] line in [GetCountry('NTC').GetCapital.GetName] and [target_go_daigo.GetName] of the [GetCountry('STC').GetAdjective] line in [GetCountry('STC').GetCapital.GetName] claim to be the rightful rulers of the Chrysanthemum Throne."
 nanbokuchou.1.desc.north: "$nanbokuchou.1.desc.common$\n\nEver since [target_go_daigo.GetNameWithNoTooltip] fled from [target_ashikaga.GetName] and secluded [target_go_daigo.GetHerselfHimself] in [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('yoshino')], [target_go_daigo.GetSheHe] has been a thorn in the side of the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('japanese_shogunate').GetName] authority."
 nanbokuchou.1.desc.south: "$nanbokuchou.1.desc.common$\n\nThe Emperor, [target_go_daigo.GetNameWithNoTooltip], was forced to flee from [target_ashikaga.GetName] and [target_koumyou.GetNameWithNoTooltip] was enthroned in [target_go_daigo.GetHerHis] stead."
 nanbokuchou.1.desc.neutral: "$nanbokuchou.1.desc.common$\n\nBoth Emperors have their own set of supporters, and the clash between both sides is unavoidable. Some small changes in allegiances could be enough to tip the scales towards one side or the other. We have maintained our neutrality, without swearing allegiance to either of the sides, but we could easily change that."
 nanbokuchou.1.a: "We stand firm on our position."
 nanbokuchou.1.b: "Actually, they seem to be more promising."

 nanbokuchou.2.title: "End of the $nanbokuchou$"
 nanbokuchou.2.desc: "The turbulent times of a divided court are at an end. The constant squabbles initiated by [GetCharacter('jap_go_daigo_tenno').GetName] have been resolved by the unification under the [target_emperor.GetLongName]. No longer will our country see itself divided due to multiple conflicting loyalties. The legitimacy of [target_emperor.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] is unquestioned and people will rally together under [target_emperor.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerHis] authority and that of the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('japanese_shogunate').GetLeaderTitle]. There will be no more internal struggles and division, and all clans will be unified towards a common goal."

 nanbokuchou.3.desc: "The current conflict between the [target_supported_court.GetLongName] and the [target_enemy_court.GetLongName] has been shaking the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('japanese_shogunate').GetName] for a while. [target_shogun.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] and [GetCountry('NTC').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] continue to oppose the claim to the throne of [GetCountry('STC').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName]. We have been until now also giving our loyal support to the [target_supported_court.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip], but winds of change are on the horizon.\n\nWeary of so much struggle, both sides seem to take their support for granted, and that does not sit well with many among our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. Envoys from the [target_enemy_court.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip] has approached us and [target_enemy_court.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] promises better rewards if we offer our loyalty to [target_enemy_court.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerHim]."

 nanbokuchou.4.title: "Betrayal"
 nanbokuchou.4.desc: "The vile rats of the [target_betrayer.GetLongName] are just animals without honor. Seeing our constant struggles with the [target_enemy_court.GetLongName], they have abandoned their ties of loyalty towards us and have run towards their side, seduced by the false promises of [target_enemy_court.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName]. They no doubt see our position as weak and think they may take advantage of the situation, but we will prove them otherwise. Now we will meet on the battlefield."
 nanbokuchou.4.a: "Traitors!"

 nanbokuchou.5.title: "The Cost of War"
 nanbokuchou.5.desc: "The constant squabble between the [GetCountry('NTC').GetLongName] and the [GetCountry('STC').GetLongName] has been engulfing all the clans for a while. Blood has been shed and skillful warriors have been lost, and yet the fight continues. This division of the Imperial Line is a scar on our nation that will take time to heal, if it ever does.

 nanbokuchou.6.title: "A Time of Conflict"

 nanbokuchou.7.title: "Time to Strike"
 nanbokuchou.7.desc: "The [target_enemy.GetLongName] have been opposing us for too long, but the constant struggles of the $nanbokuchou$ bring us the best opportunity to retaliate.
