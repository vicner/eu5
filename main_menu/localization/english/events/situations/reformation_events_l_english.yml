 reformation.1.title: "The Lutheran Reformation"
 reformation.1.desc: "Thoughts of disapproval against the Roman [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('catholic_church').GetName] are spreading across [ShowContinentName('europe')] following the increasing practice of indulgences, raising questions concerning the greed of the Church.\n\nWhile these stayed rather broad and general accusations for now, a particular incident in [target_location.GetName] has caused a humble monk by the name of [target_character.GetName] to write and publish a thesis on the nature of true worship and the nature of our faith. [target_character.GetSheHe|U] is specifically targeting the selling of indulgences, defaming them as greedy and unnecessary, as well as disputing the authority of the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('catholic_church').GetLeaderTitle] to sell the same forgiveness that only God can grant."
 reformation.1.a: "Only time will tell what this might bring."

 reformation.2.title: "Bible Translated"
 reformation.2.desc: "A priest in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] has translated the Bible into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCourtLanguage.GetName], and has started to distribute copies of it to nearby villages throughout [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. They claim that translating bibles to other languages than [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLiturgicalLanguage.GetName] gives people the best resource for knowing God in a language that speaks to their minds and hearts. However, the Church opposes this, as this is clearly against the will of God!"

 reformation.3.desc: "The Reformation has set [ShowContinentName('europe')] ablaze! Theologians in every [ShowBuildingTypeName('university')] and every church have no other topic but to comment on the work of [target_luther.GetName].\n\nIn our own territory, in the institutions of [target_location.GetName], a group of reformers emerged, spearheaded by [target_character.GetName]. [target_character.GetSheHe|U] is preaching of the corruption of [ShowReligionName('catholic')] and of the dire need of reform not only in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] but in the [GetInternationalOrganization('catholic_church').GetName], with or without the support of the entire Church."

 reformation.12.desc: "What once were whispers of gossip in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] has now manifested in a direct confession of [target_character.GetHerHim]. [target_character.GetSheHe|U] seems to no longer be able to proclaim [target_character.GetHerHis] faith in the one true [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] and to be taking a liking to heresies instead."

 reformation.14.desc: "[target_character.GetName], a fairly important member of our [ShowBuildingTypeName('university')] in [target_location.GetName], is publicly practicing [target_character.GetReligion.GetName] and [target_character.GetHerHis] teachings reflect opinions that are hardly in line with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] doctrine. If we do not remove [target_character.GetHerHim] from [target_character.GetHerHis] position, this could propel the [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('university')] of [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip] to be a bastion of heresy in the future."

 reformation.15.desc: "The [ShowBuildingTypeName('monastery')] in [target_location.GetName] has voluntarily joined the Reformation! The monks that previously inhabited the estate repurposed the building as a center of [ShowReligionAdjective('lutheran')] teachings. These [ShowBuildingTypeName('lutheran_preachers')] could tear our country's unity apart with their heresies if nothing is done!"

 reformation.16.desc: "While we have taken the most radical steps towards embracing the ideas of [target_luther.GetName] and we claim the residence of some of the most important reformers of our age, our work can not be done with that. The reformers, just like [target_luther.GetNameWithNoTooltip] [target_luther.GetHerselfHimself], often struggle for financial funds to continue their work. We should support them, if we are truly invested in the survival of [ShowReligionName('lutheran')]."
 reformation.16.a: "Give them what they ask for."
 reformation.16.b: "God will surely provide for them."
