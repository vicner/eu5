 little_ice_age.1.desc: "The recent years have hosted a series of winters far harsher than usual. Crop failures, starvation, and the encroaching cold have made life in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] a challenge. In the midst of this, our farmers have begun noticing lesser returns from their harvests, as granaries run dangerously low. The people know not what sin has caused such divine wrath, but alas we remain hopeful that the sun will return to its full glory."
 little_ice_age.1.historical_info: "Marked by by a series of cooling periods that affected much of the Northern hemisphere, the beginning of the #italic Little Ice Age#! was likely triggered by a combination of factors, including reduced solar activity, increased volcanic eruptions, and changes in ocean currents. As the temperature dropped, longer and harsher winters took over, resulting in unique events such as the freezing of the Thames in London coinciding with a volcanic winter triggered by the eruption of Huaynaputina. In combination with famines across Europe, this period is known for some of the lowest temperatures in several centuries."

Despite the adversities brought forth by the [ShowSituationName('little_ice_age')], we have survived, overcoming the latest obstacle in a series of hardships. The icy landscape across our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] may not be retreating entirely yet, but the worst part is behind us. Life has been quite harsh as crops failed consistently, the threat of starvation has pushed many to the brinks of abandoning their humanity. Despite this, we embrace the next day with a warm smile and the intention to persevere!"
