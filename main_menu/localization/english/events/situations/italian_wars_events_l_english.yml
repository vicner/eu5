  italian_wars.1.historical_info: "The Italian Wars (1494-1559) were a series of violent conflicts to determine the domination of Italy, mainly fought by France and Spain with a substantial part of Europe involved in this clash of powers. They began when Charles VIII of France invaded Italy in 1494, taking Naples, but Maximilian I of Habsburg, and Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon, the Catholic Kings of Spain, rushed to the aid of the Pope to drive him out. The king of France then took Milan, Genoa, and Naples again in 1499, but Spain expelled them back from Naples in 1503, asserting their control over Southern Italy, and Pope Julius II formed an alliance to push the French out of northern Italy. A few years later, Francis I of France revived the French claim over Milan, which was taken in 1515, but in 1525 he lost a decisive battle in Pavia to Emperor Charles V, also King Charles I of Spain, and was captured. Francis I was released after formally renouncing all the French claims in Italy, but then he allied with England, the Pope, Venice, and Florence, with the resulted in the sack of Rome by the German landsknechts of Charles V in 1527, a peace with the Pope, and the imperial coronation of Charles V in Bologna in 1529. The wars finally ended in 1559 with the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis, leaving the Spanish Habsburgs as the dominant power in Italy for 150 years."
