 innovativeness_events.1.title: "Freedom of the Press"
 innovativeness_events.1.desc: "With the spread of Popular Literacy a great number of cheap minor publications; pamphlets, chapbooks and similar, have begun to circulate in greater numbers. While many of them are just popular ballads, stories or gossip, some are thinly veiled attempts at criticizing the pillars of our state, and the religious establishment.\nThe spread of a particularly immoral and political ballad has led to demands that we limit the press more harshly and that we take disloyal printers and their products into our care."
 innovativeness_events.1.a: "Forbid the publication."
 innovativeness_events.1.b: "It is just a piece of paper."
 innovativeness_events.3.title: "Anatomical Theater"
 innovativeness_events.3.desc: "Local doctors in [SCOPE.sLocation('doctor_location').GetName] have begun to pay good money to study fresh corpses. The physicians claim this allows them to improve their knowledge of the human body, documenting it for the betterment of mankind. Improving the grasp of human anatomy is not an argument that impresses locals when the graves of recently deceased are found open in the morning however. The citizens of [SCOPE.sLocation('doctor_location').GetNameWithNoTooltip] are now demanding that we restrict these horrible practices and that we put a stop to the grave robbers."
 innovativeness_events.3.a: "Reprimand and restrict the doctors."
 innovativeness_events.3.b: "They can dissect the bodies of the convicted."
 innovativeness_events.3.c: "Let us work to secure a constant supply of bodies for their work."
 innovativeness_events.4.title: "Foreign Inventor"
 innovativeness_events.4.desc: "A brilliant [SCOPE.sCountry('inventor_country').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] inventor from [SCOPE.sCountry('inventor_country').GetName] has come to seek our patronage after a falling out with the [SCOPE.sCountry('inventor_country').GetGovernment.GetGovernmentType.GetName]. The inventor has been described by some as one of the great minds of this age, producing many mechanical and chemical inventions beyond the understanding of most others."
 innovativeness_events.4.a: "Let us take him in!"
 harbored_inventor: "Harbored Hostile Inventor"
 innovativeness_events.4.b: "We would not risk the anger of our neighbors."
 turned_away_inventor: "Turned Away Inventor"
 innovativeness_events.6.title: "State Patronage"
 innovativeness_events.6.desc: "Among some of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] it has become increasingly fashionable to spend time on experimentation and philosophy. Some have begun to form regular discussion groups while others use letters to correspond with other inquisitive minds.\nOne such group has contacted our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], asking for patronage and support. They insist that such endorsement will bring great benefits to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetGovernmentType.GetName] in the near future."
 innovativeness_events.6.a: "They shall have our endorsement."
 innovativeness_events.6.b: "What a waste of time!"
 innovativeness_events.7.title: "[ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('university')] of [university_province.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 innovativeness_events.7.desc: "The [ShowBuildingTypeName('university')] of [university_province.GetName] has attracted a new strand of teachers and students who are eager to modernize the institution. They are asking for funding to open a new college where they can further develop what they call 'new science', with a more experimental outlook and what they claim to be a less dogmatic approach to the world.\n\nOf course, within the existing academy there is some resistance to these would-be reformers. They argue that the money could be better spent supporting the existing institution as new ideas are not necessarily better ideas."
 innovativeness_events.7.a: "Enlarge the [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('university')]? Sounds like a good idea."
 innovativeness_events.7.b: "Let us listen to the conservatives."
 innovativeness_events.8.title: "Dissenting Academies"
 innovativeness_events.8.desc: "Institutions of higher learning typically restrict enrollment to adherents of the dominant faith. This forces nonconforming prospective students to seek their education outside of state-sanctioned universities. Thankfully for them, a number of informal academies have been founded in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] that cater to religious dissidents of various sorts, often promoting a particular theological position. Such academies may strictly be at odds with the law, as schools generally require the assent of local or national religious authorities, but they provide education to students who would otherwise be barred from admission."
 innovativeness_events.8.a: "Let them teach as they please."
 innovativeness_events.8.b: "Religious uniformity must be enforced."
 innovativeness_events.9.title: "Treatise on Natural Philosophy"
 innovativeness_events.9.desc: "A promising thinker to some, a dangerous instigator to others, a natural scientist has recently published a new work of natural philosophy, showing that it is very likely that many of the things we have held evident up until now might in fact be wrong. To make matters worse the thinker has also used the opportunity provided by the publication to mock the religious establishment. Taken together this has created a strong aversion against these new ideas, with some arguing that he should be incarcerated and punished, while others at the very least distance themselves from the text."
 innovativeness_events.9.a: "These are interesting ideas..."
 innovativeness_events.9.b: "We cannot allow such blasphemy!"
 innovativeness_events.10.title: "Unpopular Mathematician"
 innovativeness_events.10.desc: "Like many rulers of this age [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] has wanted to surround [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerselfHimself] with great minds that can debate the secrets of the world. Some poses great wit and excel at debates, while others are more suited for solitary experiments or mathematical calculations. There is no doubt quite a bit of rivalry at times, as the favor of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] can be a very beneficial thing to have for any thinker, scientist or inventor.\nOne such intelligent fool has lately come to be ridiculed by many peers. He has a great mind for mathematics but is a notably poor debater, and some would argue the reputation of the court suffers for indulging such work."
 innovativeness_events.10.a: "Let them talk."
 innovativeness_events.10.b: "He is embarrassing us."
 innovativeness_events.11.title: "Terra Australis"
 innovativeness_events.11.desc: "Scholars as ancient as Aristotle have theorized that there must exist a great unknown continent in the extreme south of the world. Now that traversing the globe has become dramatically more accessible, explorers, cartographers, and scientists are beginning to take an interest in the missing continent once again. They speculate that some of the islands thus far discovered in the region may be the terminus of large archipelagos. An expedition to the far south would be expensive, take a great deal of preparation, and test the limits of our seafaring technology."
 innovativeness_events.11.a: "Fund a research and exploratory expedition."
 innovativeness_events.11.b: "This is a waste of time and resources."
 innovativeness_events.12.title: "Coffee Houses"
 innovativeness_events.12.desc: "The introduction of coffee to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has hit the nation by storm, with coffee houses springing up in cities throughout the land. Miniscule admission fees ensure that the educated and uneducated, rich and poor alike can go to a coffee house and join the lively debates within. Popular topics of discussion include philosophy, politics, gossip, and finance. A natural meeting place for intellectuals, the coffee house is becoming synonymous with debate and learning."
 innovativeness_events.12.a: "Encourage these gatherings."
 innovativeness_events.12.b: "Dangerous ideas are spreading."
 innovativeness_events.13.title: "Scientific Instruments"
 innovativeness_events.13.desc: "With new developments in the art of glassmaking and metalwork comes the ability to create more refined scientific instruments. Lenses that magnify the very distant and the very small are invaluable to our astronomers and natural philosophers, while chemists hone their craft with more complex metal tools. Recent breakthroughs have given [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] a scientific edge in the production of this equipment. We can but eagerly await the discoveries that have been made possible."
 innovativeness_events.13.a: "Can they turn lead into gold yet?"
 innovativeness_events.14.title: "Physiocrats"
 innovativeness_events.14.desc: "A new flavor of economics, known as physiocracy, is becoming popular among the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] . Physiocrats hold that the basis of wealth is agricultural production, by which all of civilization is made possible. The most important members of society therefore, are the landed gentry who own the fields and lease the land. The physiocrats reject the dominant economics of mercantilism in favor of an agrarian laissez faire approach; merchants of course do not generate wealth, but merely transport extraneous produce from place to place. While many find the depth of their economics impressive, others are more swayed by the tangible benefits of existing protectionist policies."
 innovativeness_events.14.a: "Perhaps this is worth a try."
 innovativeness_events.14.b: "Landowners have too many privileges already."
 innovativeness_events.15.title: "Cabinet of Curiosities"
 innovativeness_events.15.desc: "The exploration of new lands and the opening of trade with distant nations has brought all manner of curious objects to our shores. It has become fashionable to gather collections of these often bizarre items and display them alongside more mundane treasures such as portraits and religious icons. These fantastic collections include trophies from strange or mythical animals, artifacts from unknown cultures, rare minerals, and brightly-colored shells from foreign shores. These cabinet exhibits are visited not only by curious aristocrats but also by naturalists interested in their scientific value. Of course it sometimes turns out that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s prized unicorn horn is simply the tusk of a narwhal."
 innovativeness_events.15.a: "How very novel. Commission one immediately."
 innovativeness_events.15.b: "This is silly. We should patronize religious institutions instead."
 innovativeness_events.16.t: "The Philosopher's Stone"
 innovativeness_events.16.desc: "Groups of alchemists have gathered before the court, desiring funding to expand their research. Their proto-scientific language wrapped in mysticism speaks of great bounty, gold from base metals, a cure to any plague, an elixir of life, perhaps even the discovery of the Philosopher's Stone!\n\nOf course, court experts advise against funding this group, as they have no track record of useful alchemical discoveries. Funding the alchemists will probably lead to some kind of discovery, though it is hard to tell if they will actually meet their stated research goals..."
 innovativeness_events.16.a: "Turn lead to gold!"
 innovativeness_events.16.b: "Cure any disease!"
 innovativeness_events.16.c: "Search high and low for the Philosopher's Stone!"
 innovativeness_events.16.d: "Fools! You will get no money out of us!"
 innovativeness_events.16.event_notifier: "The alchemists will conduct research for 6 months..."

 innovativeness_events.17.desc: "The alchemists have come back empty-handed, wasting an incredible amount of state funds in search of a delusion. In fear of punishment for their folly, they have escaped to a neighboring country. Presumably to ask them for funding too.\n\nBut this was not an entirely fruitless endeavor, their workshop is littered with unrelated but otherwise useful research, alongside a large amount of raw goods that were presumably used for the alchemical task we handed them. We've already repossessed them, even if they may not make up for the costs incurred."
 innovativeness_events.17.a: "At least it was not a complete waste..."
