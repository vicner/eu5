 devotion_events.2.title: "Fort Maintenance"
 devotion_events.2.desc: "Our forts are the most important defense we have against intruders and enemies, but they are in great need of restoration. We would need to increase our taxes in order to fund this, and that will most certainly upset those who feel they already pay exorbitant taxes."

 devotion_events.2.b: "Do what is possible with the money we already have."
 devotion_events.3.title: "Modernization of the Forts"
 devotion_events.3.desc: "The forts no longer look as if they would crumble before our eyes, they are now sturdy enough to withstand most attacks to their walls. Their defenses, although now functional and impressive despite their age, are still lacking in comparison to other nations' forts. We would need to dig deep into the pockets of our taxpayers in order to be able to fund the upgrades and the modernization our forts sorely need."
 devotion_events.3.a: "It is for the greater good; who wants to be invaded?"
 devotion_events.3.b: "They are good enough as they are."
 devotion_events.4.title: "Too High Taxes"
 devotion_events.4.desc: "It is hard to hear our citizens rage against the raised taxes from the high, high walls and inside the thick, thick towers of our restored forts, but we do hear them threatening revolt and rebellion unless we lower the taxes."

 devotion_events.7.title: "False Beliefs"
 devotion_events.7.desc: "One of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]'s purposes is to spread the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] faith and protect it from heresy. It is a noble cause, but when heresy strikes in the very heart of our country it shames us. The [target_location.GetRank.GetName] of [target_location.GetName] does not follow the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] faith and, if this situation is not addressed soon, it will bring us great shame."

 devotion_events.7.b: "Then we shall be ashamed."
 devotion_events.8.title: "Forgery of Documents"
 devotion_events.8.desc: "It is a common defense against annexation and usurpation to forge documents, have them counterfeited or backdated, to corroborate one's arguments during times of struggles for expansion of land or privileges. Even now, these questionable methods are still used, and even we ponder if this practice should benefit us. We have done so in the past, but there is always the chance that someone will detect the discrepancies."

 devotion_events.8.b: "Keep that filth out of our archives!"
 devotion_events.9.title: "Forged Documents"

 devotion_events.12.title: "The Merchant's [target_heir.GetDaughterSon]"
 devotion_events.12.desc: "A shrewd mind for negotiations, and a talent for bargaining that must come from [target_heir.GetHerHis] merchant parents, have made [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')], free [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')], and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] respect and fear [target_heir.GetName]. They will never attempt to fool [target_heir.GetHerHim] in any kinds of bargains or negotiations when [target_heir.GetSheHe] leads our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
 devotion_events.12.a: "Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle] might be a mere merchant's [target_heir.GetDaughterSon], but [target_heir.GetSheHe] has proven [target_heir.GetHerselfHimself]!"

 devotion_events.14.desc: "The people rejoiced when the local preacher, [target_heir.GetName], was chosen as the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle] of [target_ruler.GetName] of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName]. Were they rejoicing because they saw an end to [target_heir.GetHerHis] constant sermons, or because they believed in [target_heir.GetHerHim] being able to make a difference in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]? No matter what, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] support and trust the next [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], [target_heir.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."

 devotion_events.26.title: "The Influential Reformer"
 devotion_events.26.desc: "A no-nonsense [target_heir.GetWomanMan], well-versed in the art of rhetoric, the next ruler [target_heir.GetName] is already using [target_heir.GetHerHis] powers for good, spreading [target_heir.GetHerHis] ideas to any who will listen - members of the high society are eager to prove their intellect to [target_heir.GetHerHim], while others are simply fascinated by the fashionable [target_heir.GetWomanMan]. Regardless of why, there is clearly something special about [target_heir.GetNameWithNoTooltip], as even folks usually completely uninterested in politics find themselves taking part of the discussion."

 devotion_events.15.title: "Rule Challenged"
 devotion_events.15.desc: "It began, as it always does, with rumors, gossip, and sneaked glances filled with contempt and malice. If this challenge to [target_ruler.GetName]'s rule goes too far, that [target_ruler.GetSheHe] was not elected properly to the seat of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], people will no longer speak but might try to depose [target_ruler.GetHerHim]!"

 devotion_events.16.title: "Campaign Against Superstitious Practices"
 devotion_events.16.desc: "The strict, dictatorial attitude of [target_ruler.GetName] has provoked the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], who demand that [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s attempts to limit superstitious practices cease. The rage exuded from these simpletons over misguided traditions and pointless, non-doctrinal practices is baffling."

 devotion_events.16.b: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] is in the right!"
 devotion_events.18.title: "The Mad Seer"
 devotion_events.18.desc: "[mad_seer.GetSheHe|U] claims to be a seer who has seen the civic glory, the destruction of secular art and culture, and the great flood that will cleanse [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] from its filth. The mad preacher calls for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] renewal and has instituted an extreme puritanical campaign. Enlisting the help of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s young men, there is a risk that [mad_seer.GetSheHe] will cause disturbances or even dispute [target_ruler.GetName]'s right to rule!"
 devotion_events.18.a: "Make sure [mad_seer.GetSheHe] is silenced, for good!"

By establishing and supporting like-minded people within the dissenting institutions, they can help us persuade the reluctant populace to change their minds on our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s proposed policies."
 devotion_events.19.a: "We will start with our own advisors."

 devotion_events.21.title: "The Secularists Among Us"
 devotion_events.21.desc: "Each incident that lowers our devotion to our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] sees more and more trouble approaching our doorstep. There are those that believe that religious considerations should be excluded from civil affairs, and their numbers have grown. They clamor for change and wish for us to secularize our government."
 devotion_events.21.a: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will shed [target_ruler.GetHerHis] religious garments for a crown!"

 devotion_events.100.b: "Enforce our authority!"
 devotion_events.101.title: "The Lanterne of Light"
 devotion_events.101.desc: "The heinous heretical book 'The Lanterne of Light' claims that the principal cause of the persecution of the original Christians was the illegal retention of precious goods by priests. It also goes on to compare the seats of archbishops or bishops with those of the Antichrist. This book has been found in the possession of a group of relapsed heretics that, despite many years in prison and many tearful abjurations, still refuse to change their ways."
 devotion_events.101.a: "Sentence the heretics to prison once more."

 devotion_events.104.desc: "There is a vigorous preacher in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] whose outdoor sermons about the temptations of vanity objects have led to [preacher.GetHerHis] supporters collecting and burning cosmetics, arts, books deemed immoral, and musical instruments. [preacher.GetSheHe|U] rages on about how these objects might tempt one to sin and urges people, especially the famous artists of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], to bring the things [preacher.GetSheHe] deems immoral to [preacher.GetHerHis] bonfires."

 devotion_events.107.desc: "A jubilee - a holy year - involves pilgrimage to a sacred site such as [ShowLocationName('rome')] or our own capital. It is a special year of remission of sins and universal pardons, something [pope.GetName] usually convokes every 25 or 50 year, but who is [pope.GetSheHe] to say that we cannot convoke our own jubilee in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]?"
 devotion_events.107.desc_pope: "A Jubilee, a tradition dating back to the times of [GetCharacter('pap_boniface_viii').GetName], is a special year of remission of sins, and it involves many pilgrimages to [ShowLocationName('rome')].

 devotion_events.109.a: "[pope.GetSheHe|U] does not like it, not at all."
 devotion_events.109.b: "We need not worry. [pope.GetSheHe|U] approves!"
 devotion_events.117.title: "Confiscation of a [ShowReligionAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('calvinist')|U] Church"
 devotion_events.117.desc: "A group of monks have confiscated a [ShowReligionAdjective('calvinist')] church in [target_location.GetName]! Their actions were not sanctioned by [target_ruler.GetName] and, had we known about their intentions, we would have persuaded the monks to choose another building for their chapel. This has of course upset the people of the affected [target_location.GetRank.GetName], and even though we forced the monks to return the church, the enraged [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] will not forget the slight."

 devotion_events.118.desc: "The late [old_ruler.GetName] feared for [old_ruler.GetHerHis] place in heaven and collected many relics to ensure as little time was spent in purgatory as possible.

 devotion_events.118.a: "The sale of indulgences is what triggered [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetNameWithNoTooltip]! Keep them hidden."

 devotion_events.119.desc: "The whispers and glances at [target_ruler.GetName] when [target_ruler.GetSheHe] travels the streets of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] are caused by a disturbing rumor.

Be not in face of them a voracious animal, counting them as easy prey, for they are of two kinds: either they are your brothers in religion or your equals in creation. Error catches them unaware, deficiencies overcome them, evil deeds and sins are committed by them intentionally and by mistake. So grant them your pardon and your forgiveness to the same extent that you hope [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] will grant you His pardon and His forgiveness. For you are above them, and he who appointed you is above you, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] is above him who appointed you.

 devotion_events.203.desc: "The House of Wealth administers the taxes and serves as a treasury which manages personal finances and government expenditures. It administers the $zakah$ as well, the tax every wealthy [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('muslim')] pays to be distributed to those in need, unemployed, injured, or otherwise incapable to work. This last year, regardless of whatever problems our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] faced, our people managed to have an exceptional one.

Ḡālib al-Ansārī al-Šarrāṭ - whose works of legal theory, jurisprudence, and mysticism showed her great knowledge of Islamic sciences, are all great examples of what happens when you educate women. Throughout history, women have shown that they are willing and able to learn about [ShowReligionGroupNameWithNoTooltip('muslim')] and to continue the work of spreading [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetName].

 devotion_events.207.desc: "Each and every governor has their financial assets and other details recorded before they are appointed.

 devotion_events.212.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] called for a meeting, a majlis, to discuss important and urgent matters in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. Though their faces were honest and their words true, their intentions were deceitful and dishonest! Money squandered, prestige lost, and the hopes of a just majlis for our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]'s good shattered and broken!"
 devotion_events.212.a: "We trusted them and they betrayed us!"
 devotion_events.212.b: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] blames [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] for being too naïve."
 devotion_events.213.title: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCabinetMemberTitle|U] Accused of Shirk"
 devotion_events.213.desc: "The work of a diligent [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCabinetMemberTitle] will expose them and, by extension, us to different cultures, religions, and traditions. We have always chosen to avert our gaze from the peculiar habits of [minister.GetName] and the obsession our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCabinetMemberTitle] has with illuminated manuscripts and miniatures. Though our suspicions grew when we heard gossip and tales from servants and people of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle], we would never have anticipated the look on [minister.GetHerHis] face when the imām accused [minister.GetHerHim] of shirk - practicing idolatry!"
 devotion_events.213.a: "Remove [minister.GetHerHim] from our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle], immediately!"
 devotion_events.213.b: "Dismiss the notion!"
 devotion_events.214.title: "Abolish Idolatry?"
 devotion_events.214.desc: "We have been informed that [target_ruler.GetName]'s rule is questioned by our advisors. Apparently, the people are doubting [target_ruler.GetHerHis] piety. We must do something to establish a religious and political sovereignty! Idolatry is [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetSinName], but still our people offer prayers to saintly figures, make pilgrimages to tombs and mosques, venerate trees, caves, and even stones. We must show our religious strength and abolish these things to grasp the power that is legitimately [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s!"
 devotion_events.214.a: "Go ahead, forbid them all!"
 devotion_events.214.b: "Why bother?"
 devotion_events.215.title: "Taxes or Agriculture"
 devotion_events.215.desc: "The people of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] are nomads and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] who live off what the land provides. With this in mind, our governors need us to decide whether we should focus on taxes or agriculture. Some claim that the development of land is more important than the collection of the tax. Tax can only be obtained by the development of the land, and to demand tax without doing so will ruin our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] and destroy its people. Others claim that people will develop the land without interference if just tax is demanded of them."
 devotion_events.215.a: "Focus on taxes."
 devotion_events.215.b: "Focus on agriculture."
 devotion_events.215.c: "Try to balance the two."
 devotion_events.215.d: "Our current policy is fine as is."
 devotion_events.216.title: "Reforms of the Pious"
 devotion_events.216.desc: "After many meetings, discussions, and majlis, our advisors have brought us different reforms for us to consider. Two main factions have emerged with competing reforms, from which we are expected to choose one to improve our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. The first one proposes that we exclude state officials, such as diplomats and governors, from entering into any business. This would let them fully concentrate on their work in service to our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], thus allowing them to do a better job. The second reform proposes that we distribute pasture lands and game reserves, which are currently reserved for the family of dignitaries, among the poor so that they may cultivate the land. Unpaid labor would also be made illegal."
 devotion_events.216.a: "Exclude state officials from entering any business."
 devotion_events.216.b: "Distribute lands among the poor."
 devotion_events.216.c: "Choose none of them."
 devotion_events.219.title: "The Qāḍī, the Ḥisba, and the Muḥtasib"
 devotion_events.219.desc: "It has not been many months since we appointed a new Qāḍī - a judge ruling in accordance with $sharia$ - to each of our provinces, yet many of them already come to us with furrowed brows and anxious eyes. They tell us of our people's decadence, their crimes, and their impious ways. They have reminded us sternly of Ḥisba, our divinely sanctioned duty to intervene and command right and forbid wrong. The laws of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] must be followed. Our people need muṭṭawwi'īn - religious police - to enforce $sharia$."
 devotion_events.219.a: "Find volunteers and train them to become Muḥtasibīn."
 devotion_events.219.b: "This not the correct way to deal with this."
