 steppe_horde.1.title: "A Moving City"
 steppe_horde.1.desc: "There are ancient tales of moving palaces crumbling down to the ground in the desert's sands. Fragile and shifting mirages have come and gone, disappeared as the names of the men who had lived and died in their secret chambers. But all legends are born from a shady truth, the echo of what has passed.\n\nWe are those moving palaces, those disappearing dwellers. Our cities are not built in stone, but on bones."

 steppe_horde.2.title: "Ancestral Temple"
 steppe_horde.2.desc: "One of our hosts got lost during a hunting expedition and they have discovered an abandoned shrine of the [target_religion.GetAdjective] faith in the depths of our land. Perfect beliefs must be impenetrable, as rigid stones drowned in nature's last blow, but still trying to get some air. Remnants of times long past under a faint distillation of light, its understructure strong as tamed horses.\n\nOur soldiers were struck by its perfect obscurity. They could not scream, for the supremacy of that temple made them go silent with reverence."
 steppe_horde.2.a: "We must respect our ancestors."
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_ancestral_temple: "Ancestral Temple"

 steppe_horde.5.title: "The Silence of the Lambs"
 steppe_horde.5.desc: "Months and years had been spent underneath these unwavering stars, our lambs the only animal who would feed our wandering mouths, dust the only trail of life that we could follow.\n\nAnd then something stopped. Our livestock started to fall one by one, their harmless backs turned to the ground like a carpet in our tents. Words were quickly spread about curses, spells, hexes.\n\nThe only certain thing is that death took what belonged to life. Without our livestock's meat, our people will soon follow their fate. We could try to remediate the issue by appealing to our diplomatic contacts, or by securing 'alternative' sources of meat from other lands."

 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_the_elephant_man: "The Elephant Man"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_the_elephant_man: "Some shady individual has secured us an alternative source of meat in the form of elephants brought from far-away lands. For some reason, having elephants roaming in the steppes does not feel that weird."

 steppe_horde.6.title: "Corrupted Mind"
 steppe_horde.6.desc: "It was a custom of [target_ruler.GetName] to wander around the proximities of [target_ruler.GetHerHis] palace, losing [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] in the thicket in the pursuit of some peace. But today, [target_ruler.GetSheHe] came back... slightly changed. When [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] arrived at the palace this morning, [target_ruler.GetHerHis] eyes were bright red, [target_ruler.GetHerHis] mouth dry as a wasteland, [target_ruler.GetHerHis] voice cracked when [target_ruler.GetSheHe] stated that [target_ruler.GetSheHe] would eat the scraps of [target_ruler.GetHerHis] lover's heart from the ground like a hungry dog.\n\nIn the fear of [target_ruler.GetHerHis] sanity, a group of explorers followed [target_ruler.GetHerHis] steps and found both a convincing and disturbing answer: harmful fumes had been emanating from a nearby cavern."
 steppe_horde.6.a: "This is not possible!"
 steppe_horde.6.b: "Actually, [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] is not that different."
 steppe_horde.6.c: "Let us just seal that cave."

 steppe_horde.7.title: "Seat of Power"
 steppe_horde.7.desc: "Being a wandering civilization, the source of our power is not in a settled place, but emanates from the figure of [target_ruler.GetName] and thus is wherever [target_ruler.GetSheHe] is. However, even the mightiest [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] cannot roam around endlessly, and the establishment of a permanent base always has its own benefits. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] finds [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] in [target_location.GetName] quite often, so a more permanent seat there would do no harm, but it will need to secure its defenses."
 steppe_horde.7.a: "Let us reinforce it!"

 steppe_horde.15.b: "Compromise with the clans."

 steppe_horde.16.title: "Tribal Feud"
 steppe_horde.16.desc: "During the height of the summer festivities in our capital, members of two feuding clans have decided to have a public showdown and fight it out in front of the entire political and religious leadership of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]! The ensuing violence was so fierce that not only the feuding clansmen lost their lives, but also countless bystanders and even members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] guard."
 steppe_horde.16.a: "Vile rabble! How dare they!"
 steppe_horde.16.b: "This is the way of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."

 steppe_horde.17.desc: "While on a hunt, [target_heir.GetName] and [target_heir.GetHerHis] guards were ambushed by a band of unknown assassins. Outnumbered and attacked from cover, all but one fell there and then. The survivor, though wounded by a poison arrow, lived long enough to tell us of a valiant last stand of [target_heir.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]. Tall and mighty [target_heir.GetSheHe] stood, cutting the creatures of the night one by one as they surrounded [target_heir.GetHerHim], until the last of [target_heir.GetHerHis] bodyguards succumbed. Shaken and in mourning, our people celebrate the legacy of [target_heir.GetNameWithNoTooltip] as [target_heir.GetSheHe] achieves immortality in their memory."
