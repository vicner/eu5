 regencies.1.title: "Crown the Regent"
 regencies.1.desc: "The premature death of [target_previous_ruler.GetName] forced our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] to enter a period of regency until a proper heir is found. Although by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] law, [target_character.GetName] should not be the ruler, [target_character.GetSheHe] has gained the popularity and support of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')].\n\nNaturally, an ambitious person like [target_character.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] is more than interested in acquiring the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] leadership. But in the end, it is the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] who decide if [target_character.GetSheHe] is worthy to rule over the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip]."
 regencies.1.a: "This is a good idea!"
 regencies.1.a.japanese.tt: "This will make us stop having the [target_previous_ruler.GetDynasty.GetName] dynasty, which will also change the identity of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]"
 regencies.1.founds_dynasty_tt: "Founds a new [dynasty|e] in [THIS.GetCharacter.GetLocation.GetName]"
 regencies.1.a.japanese_imperial_family.tt: "We will stop being part of the [ShowGovernmentReformName('japanese_imperial_family')]"
 regencies.1.b: "Let us avoid this!"
 regencies.1.c: "Actually, [target_previous_ruler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] adopted [target_character.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] in [target_previous_ruler.GetHerHis] will."

 regencies.2.title: "No Hard Feelings"
 regencies.2.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeir.GetName]'s good education and natural charm have made [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeir.GetHerHim] a more than appropriate option to the throne. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetName]'s poor administration, however, has made [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] resent its lack of [stability|e]. The government of a nation is as difficult and delicate as collecting roses without touching a single thorn; and, sometimes, one is just not born with it. Maybe we could use one of those thorns..."
 regencies.2.a: "We must ensure the [stability|e] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Whatever it takes."
 regencies.3.title: "Even as a Shadow"
 regencies.3.desc: "After surviving the attempt to harm [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetHerHis] physical integrity, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetName] has started to feel consumed by what [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetSheHe] may call caution, whilst others may refer to it using less pleasant words. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetSheHe|U] has started to avoid social events, leaving the rest of the council alone to govern the whole nation.\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetHerHis|U] flagrant lack of responsibility has raised many suspicions among the court, however, what has greatly deteriorated the public opinion of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetName] is the strange behavior that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetSheHe] has been exhibiting lately, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetHerHis] eyes red and wide open in the middle of the night, muttering in darkness that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetSheHe] shall never leave the throne, asking for someone to come at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetHerHim] even as a shadow, even as a dream."
 regencies.3.a: "We need to immediately put an end to this."
 regencies.3.c: "It is not that bad."
 regencies.4.title: "Even as a Dream"
 regencies.4.desc: "After the unsuccessful attempt to stop [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetName] from worsening our nation's fate, the paranoia that had surrounded [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetHerHim] has only proved to be true, thus causing even a greater harm to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetHerHis] mental health. Having already interrogated the closest members of the council, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetName] has started to enter their rooms unannounced, accompanied by some [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] guards and a severe tone to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetHerHis] voice: "This must be done," is the only reply one can get from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetHerHim] while their belongings are being checked."
 regencies.4.a: "This is only one solution."
 regencies.5.title: "Wicked Minds"
 regencies.5.desc: "Gold is a dangerous thing, its tempting shine impossible to resist. It lurks in the shadows, attracting unaware fools to its doomed glow, its gilding roundness as two demon eyes. [target_character.GetName] is no stranger to this perilous feeling, [target_character.GetHerHis] annoyed face desperately looking for a new toy to play with, [target_character.GetHerHis] fingers inspecting every drawer, every pocket, trying to use [target_character.GetHerHis] hands as Midas.\n\nMeanwhile, our nation suffers, the population slowly falling into despair, their hungry mouths open in prayers."
 regencies.5.a: "We cannot let [target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip] ruin our country."
 regencies.5.c: "It is too late now!"
 regencies.6.title: "Treasure Hunt"
 regencies.6.desc: "It started with some innocent laughs, some casual comments, some sinless suggestions. Then it started transforming into some mischievous grins, some sharp comments, some sinister commands.\nThe entire palace knew that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetName] had become too used to power, but few would even consider that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetSheHe] would go this far to preserve it. Our rightful heir, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeir.GetName], has been imprisoned after being invited to "go find the special treasure" hidden in the dungeons."
 regencies.6.a: "Rumors spread around our country."
 regencies.7.title: "Glory Days"
 regencies.7.desc: "Sometimes hope is found in the most unexpected places. Since the start of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetHerHis] regency, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetName] has proven to be an excellent ruler, always aware of the necessities of our people. Some even go as far as to say that our nation would experience more prosperity if [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegent.GetSheHe] would remain in power a little bit longer...\n\nGiven the imminent age of majority of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeir.GetName], that should be by no means possible. Yet [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeir.GetHerHis] ineptitude has already infuriated most of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeir.GetHerHis] teachers, many of them leaving our court after unsuccessfully trying to rein [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeir.GetHimHer] in."
 regencies.7.a: "I am sure something can be done..."
 regencies.7.b: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeir.GetSheHe|U] is not the first incompetent heir."
