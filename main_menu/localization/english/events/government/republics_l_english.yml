 republics.1.title: "Republican Traditions debated"
 republics.1.desc: "Our young and fragile republic is experiencing severe debates, some even turning violent, between supporters of the old regime, and the sturdy defenders of liberty and freedom. How shall we react to this?"
 republics.1.a: "We need a King!"
 republics.1.b: "The Republic is sacred!"
 republics.2.title: "Freetraders winning debates"
 republics.2.desc: "The freetraders are increasingly popular, and seem to have how a majority of the support in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] now. They are advocating that we must reduce our mercantilistic tendencies."
 republics.2.a: "Freetraders we must be"
 republics.2.b: "Mercantilism is vital for the state"
 republics.4.title: "The Trial"
 republics.4.desc: "The eldest son of [target_character.GetName] is on trial for corruption and bribery. There is no doubt that the charges are true, the conviction of [target_character.GetHerHis] eldest son would be a serious personal blow to [target_character.GetHerHim]. On the other hand, we could of course interfere in the trial and secure his innocence."
 republics.4.a: "Withdraw from public life"
 republics.4.b: "See him acquitted"
 republics.5.title: "A New Coin"
 republics.5.desc: "In times past the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] used to be on the reverse side of the coins, now the republic rejects such personality cults. If we were to issue a new high purity coin we could improve people's faith in the coinage and of course all should remember who did this."
 republics.5.a: "Reject the Reform"
 republics.5.b: "Let the coins be issued"
 republics.6.title: "Foreign Plots?"
 republics.6.desc: "Wild rumors are circulating about our nobility plotting with foreign powers. Hysteria grows and the mood is fearful. The people demand that we strike at the traitors, but wiser minds say that we must let the tradition of republican justice take its course."
 republics.6.a: "Seize them and their wealth"
 republics.6.b: "Justice is above all"
 republics.7.title: "Expand the Bodyguard"
 republics.7.desc: "The office of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] is challenged by enemies within and without, and thus a strong personal bodyguard is essential to ensure that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetSheHe] remains in power. The turbulent politics of our time require this, but there are those who decry it, claiming that this new trend displays aristocratic tendencies and subverts the traditions of the Republic."
 republics.7.a: "Do it!"
 republics.7.b: "It would violate our Republican Ideals!"
 republics.8.title: "The Firebrand Preacher"
 republics.8.desc: "A preacher has appeared prophesying the end of all we know and a new beginning. The preacher gained traction with our recent war but he isn't really pushing for the kind of republic we know. We could challenge him to a trail by fire, but this could create internal problems just when we need unity."
 republics.8.a: "Allow it!"
 republics.8.b: "Give him a Trial by Fire!"
 republics.9.title: "Noble Plot"
 republics.9.desc: "With the republic looking fragile rumors have reached us that nobles are plotting to bring in hereditary succession to our great Republic."
 republics.9.a: "This is concerning"
 republics.9.b: "Remind them what happens to the enemies of the Revolution!"
 republics.10.title: "Division in the Council"
 republics.10.desc: "The republic functions because of the agreed common purpose of the rulers who in turn represent the settled will of the ruled. Our republic has been turning back on the traditions that made us strong. The lack of cohesion in our ruling council is costing us militarily."
 republics.10.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('common_string_negative')]"
 republics.11.title: "Disputes affecting governments"
 republics.11.desc: "Republics are successful when the important families are ready to put the republic's interest on a par with their own. Currently our republican traditions are under pressure and families are putting their own interests ahead of the republics. This is hurting our ability to govern, as consensus is harder to achieve."
 republics.11.a: "This is bad!"
 republics.12.title: "Trade Wars"
 republics.12.desc: "We always encouraged healthy competition between our merchants, but at the same time they always put the greater interest of the republic first. We would work together to ensure that the republic's trade was strengthened against the interest of rivals. Now this tradition is waning and the merchant class is becoming increasing fratricidal. This is hurting our country..."
 republics.12.a: "Something has to be done!"
 republics.13.title: "Ceremony Disrupted"
 republics.13.desc: "One of the core parts of a republic are the great ceremonies of state. This is a time where disagreements and disputes between the patricians are put on hold so we can display our unity of purpose and show the world our strength. At a recent ceremony disgruntled elements turned their backs on our traditions to air their disagreements with the ruling council."
 republics.13.a: "Far from ideal!"
 republics.14.title: "Trade Focus"
 republics.14.desc: "Some members of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] feel that we're not putting enough focus on national trade. It's pretty clear to everyone that we're not exactly dominating trade in this area but we could certainly do worse, at least that's what the other members are claiming. If our previous track record is anything to go by, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] are not very likely to come to any sort of agreement anytime soon unless someone is able to talk some sense into them."
 republics.14.a: "We need more merchants"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_more_merchants: "Recruitment of Merchants"
 republics.14.b: "It's efficiency we lack"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_efficienct_merchants: "Increased Merchant Efficiency"
 republics.15.title: "Trade Expansion"
 republics.15.desc: "Discussions regarding ways to expand our trade have been ongoing in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] for some time now. We already have exclusive control over a local market but there are many who are enticed by the possibilities of overseas trading. Others are convinced that the risks are too great and that more money could be made at home."
 republics.15.a: "Local trade is where our focus should be"
 republics.15.b: "Perhaps it's time to broaden our horizons"
 trade_focus: "Trade Focus"
 republics.16.title: "Budgetary Disagreements"
 republics.16.desc: "Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] seems to have some real difficulties coming to terms with how to govern our nation, whether it's agreeing on a budget, taxes, port duties or trade and customs policies. This time it's the budget, should more money be invested into research or be set aside for unforeseen expenses in the future?"
 republics.16.a: "Invest it all in research"
 republics.16.b: "Save some for future expenses"
 republics.17.title: "Disagreements in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName]"
 republics.17.desc: "Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] is divided regarding the proposal to establish a new market. Most of them cannot see any logical reason to why such a prominent trading nation as our own shouldn't have its own market, but as we all know, these things do not come cheap and therefore require careful consideration."
 republics.17.a: "Try to mediate between the two parties"
 republics.17.b: "Propose some other changes"
 republics.18.title: "Misdirected Focus"
 republics.18.desc: "A few members of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] are convinced that we're putting too much focus on military operations instead of concentrating on expanding our trade. They are complaining that too many investments are being directed into financing our military but almost nothing to improve our trade conditions."
 republics.18.a: "It's all according to plan"
 republics.18.b: "Perhaps our focus has been a bit misdirected"
 republics.19.title: "Parliamentary Problems"
 republics.19.desc: "One of our advisors has been quite busy lately, proposing new changes, one after the other. Although one could argue that [minister.GetSheHe] is only doing [minister.GetHerHis] job, [minister.GetHerHis] constant interference and attitude of 'knowing it all' in any matter even remotely related to politics is causing quite a rift in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName], there are even those that think we would do better without [minister.GetName]."
 republics.19.a: "Find someone to replace him."
 republics.19.b: "Give the advisor another chance"
 republics.20.title: "Heated Debates"
 republics.20.desc: "Some members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] are having some concerns regarding our increasingly bad reputation, they are claiming that it's having a negative effect on our trade relations. This question has been raised numerous times in the past but not that many have thought it of any consequence. This time the matter is causing some really heated debates though, perhaps we should try to settle things before they get out of hand."
 republics.20.a: "That is probably wise"
 republics.20.b: "It's not really a problem"
 republics.21.title: "Offense or Defense"
 republics.21.desc: "The ongoing war has led to some serious conflicts in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName]. On the one side there are those arguing that there is nothing to be gained by allowing the war to drag on while others are convinced that there's no turning back. Unfortunately their inability to come to some sort of agreement does nothing to improve our current situation but rather the contrary."
 republics.21.a: "Offense is probably the only option"
 republics.21.b: "Defense sounds better at this stage"
 republics.22.title: "Conflicting Opinions"
 republics.22.desc: "It seems there is always a small group of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] that cannot agree with the others. Regardless of the matter at hand this particular group always have a different opinion than everyone else."
 republics.22.a: "It's probably best to leave things as they are"
 republics.22.b: "Some restructuring might be needed"
 republics.23.title: "An infiltrator in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName]"
 republics.23.desc: "There is a spy among us! Somehow a spy has managed to infiltrate our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] and all of a sudden everyone is a suspect. We have not managed to find out who sent him yet but since our relations with some of our neighbors are somewhat strained at the moment it was probably one of them."
 republics.23.a: "That's not possible"
 republics.23.b: "That's the only reasonable explanation"
 republics.24.title: "A Traitor in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName]"
 republics.24.desc: "It would appear as though a member of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] has been selling secrets to our enemies. How else could we explain the fact that they all of a sudden seem able to predict our every move? These were decisions that were never discussed outside the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] building."
 republics.24.a: "Of course it was one of them"
 opinion_traitor: "Traitor"
 republics.24.b: "It's better to play it safe until we know more"
 republics.25.title: "Political Chaos"
 republics.25.desc: "Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName]'s indecisiveness and inability to make any kind of decision has created near chaos. Every member is trying their utmost to get their voice heard but refusing to acknowledge the opinions of anyone else."
 republics.25.a: "That's just the nature of politics"
 republics.25.b: "Some restructuring might be necessary"
 republics.26.title: "Influenced Decisions"
 republics.26.desc: "It has been brought to our attention that a certain member of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] has been accepting bribes from several different sources for influencing all kinds of national decisions."
 republics.26.a: "It has to stop"
 republics.26.b: "That cannot be true"
 republics.27.title: "Financial Disagreements"
 republics.27.desc: "Our economy isn't what it has been. The treasury is almost empty and our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] cannot seem to figure out how to handle the situation or the reasons for it to happen in the first place. Minting more money is always an option of course or raising taxes. Either way, they are waiting for us to make a decision."
 republics.27.a: "Mint more money"
 republics.27.b: "Raise taxes"
 republics.28.title: "Military Spending"
 republics.28.desc: "Some members of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] are complaining that we're spending too much money on our military. Many of them are convinced that our production and trade will suffer if we do not cut back on military expenses."
 republics.28.a: "Well, trade and production aren't as important"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_trade_and_production_cutbacks: "Trade and Production Cutbacks"
 republics.28.b: "Cut back on military expenses"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_military_cutbacks: "Military Cutbacks"
 republics.29.title: "A Strong Army or Navy?"
 republics.29.desc: "Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] is divided in regards to our military focus, some of them are advocating for a grand navy while others are more interested in a large army. Although some sort of middle way would be possible, most of them would prefer that we increased the size of our navy."
 republics.29.a: "A large navy is the only option"
 republics.29.b: "A large army would be more beneficial"
 republics.30.title: "Military Leniency"
 republics.30.desc: "Some members of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] feel that we are too lenient when it comes to asserting control over what is rightfully ours. They cannot understand how we can allow a core location like [SCOPE.sLocation('target').GetName] to be controlled by some other country and just sit idly by."
 republics.30.a: "They fail to see the bigger picture"
 republics.30.b: "It's not of any interest anymore"
 republics.31.title: "Too many liberties"
 republics.31.desc: "A few members of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] are of the opinion that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] has been taking a few too many liberties lately when it comes to governing our nation. Some are even claiming that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetSheHe] seems to lack any respect whatsoever for both the constitution and the rest of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName]."
 republics.31.a: "They are exaggerating"
 republics.31.b: "Take appropriate measurements"
 republics.32.title: "Economic Decisions"
 republics.32.desc: "Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] is constantly exploring different ways to bring more money into our state treasury but as always there are disagreements regarding the best strategy. A heavy tax raise would improve the state of our treasury considerably but it is also very likely to upset the populace, a small raise on the other hand would not improve our finances as much but would not cause that many protests either."
 republics.32.a: "A short-term solution is probably the best option"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_short_term_boost: "Short Term Boost"

 republics.33.title: "Military Expenses"

 republics.33.a: "Convince them that we can afford it"
 republics.33.b: "Agree to make some cutbacks"
 republics.34.title: "Unpopularity amongst the Elite"
 republics.34.desc: "Despite [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerHis] best intentions, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] sees [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerselfHimself] alone in front of severely unsatisfied members of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')]. It is clear that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName]'s actions made [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerHim] powerful enemies in the state. The only way to prevent an uprising is by stepping down as the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

 republics.36.title: "Areas of Research"
 republics.36.desc: "Each member of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] is requesting more money to be invested in a different area. Our army needs funding but so does our trade and production and let's not forget about our navy."
 republics.36.a: "An even spread should do the trick"
 republics.36.b: "There's no need for any extra investments"
 republics.37.title: "Lack of Support"
 republics.37.desc: "Some members of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] seem to think that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] has held his office long enough and are arguing for a new election. Apparently the reason for this is grounded in a disagreement they had with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerHim] a short while ago regarding the implementation of a new financial reform."
 republics.37.a: "Ignore them"
 republics.37.b: "Agree to hear them out once more"
 republics.39.title: "Troublesome [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName]"
 republics.39.desc: "Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] seems to have some difficulties understanding who's in charge of our government. They seem to think it's fully acceptable to make decisions without either informing or discussing the matter with us first. Whatever gave them that idea?"
 republics.39.a: "Make it a bit more clear to them"
 republics.39.b: "Let them think they have a say in things"
 republics.41.title: "Embezzlement"
 republics.41.desc: "It's becoming more and more clear to us that there aren't that many members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] that we can really trust. One of our closest advisors has just been exposed stealing money from the state treasury."
 republics.41.a: "There's probably a good explanation for this"
 republics.41.b: "Get rid of them"
