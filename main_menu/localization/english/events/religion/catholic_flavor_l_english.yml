 catholic_flavor.1.a: "Send him to [pope_capital_scope.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 catholic_flavor.1.b: "He will make a fine bishop."

 catholic_flavor.2.title: "A Prospering [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('monastery')]"
 catholic_flavor.2.desc: "The [ShowBuildingTypeName('monastery')] in [target_location.GetName] has enjoyed an era of prosperity, during which they have also attracted recognized [ShowReligionAdjective('catholic')] scholars. This success affects the rest of [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip] and is helping to bring new wealth to the area. A visit from [target_ruler.GetName] could be advisable and would be a great honor for the [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('monastery')]."
 catholic_flavor.2.a: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] should visit [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip] [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself]."
 catholic_flavor.2.b: "We will leave them to their own business."

 catholic_flavor.3.title: "A [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('monastery')] in Trouble"
 catholic_flavor.3.desc: "A [ShowBuildingTypeName('monastery')] inhabited by our monks has fallen on hard times. Due to a lack of both funding and new followers, the monastery has declined into a sad state of its former self. The monks are now begging us for help in the form of a generous donation, without which they will be unable to support the local population as they have in the past."
 catholic_flavor.3.a: "We will donate some money."
 catholic_flavor.3.b: "This is not our problem."

 catholic_flavor.4.title: "Simony?"
 catholic_flavor.4.desc: "We have a vacancy in a high position in the Church administration of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. There is a churchman from a rich family by the name of [target_character.GetName] who has made an enticing offer: If we approve and back [target_character.GetHerHis] election to the position, we will gain a large contribution to our coffers. Some more devout people claim that this practice is a sin called Simony, but what do they know?"
 catholic_flavor.4.a: "We need the money!"
 catholic_flavor.4.b: "Simony is a sin!"

 catholic_flavor.5.title: "Selling of Indulgences"
 catholic_flavor.5.desc: "$flavor_pap.1701.a$\n\nThe practice of promising absolution from earthly sins in return for money has been highly favored among [ShowReligionAdjective('catholic')] followers, or at least among those with money to spare. They are forgiven for all of their sins and are not even required to give up their vices! However, this practice has raised eyebrows among the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')], who are uncomfortable with the idea of the [GetCountry('PAP').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] enriching the [GetInternationalOrganization('catholic_church').GetName] in such a manner. Instead, they claim that [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('christian')] must show true repentance if their sins are to be forgiven.\n\nAs [target_ruler.GetName] grows older, the disputes on the matter grow more personal. [target_ruler.GetSheHe|U] has sinned, just as every [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] must to keep their rule secure. How best, then, should [target_ruler.GetSheHe] acquire forgiveness?"
 catholic_flavor.5.a: "A donation to the [GetCountry('PAP').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] shall be arranged."
 catholic_flavor.5.b: "Indulgences are the easy option; repentance is better."

 catholic_flavor.6.title: "Veneration of Relics"
 catholic_flavor.6.desc: "From the highest noble to the lowest peasant, people believe that the veneration of relics allows the supplicant to reduce their time in purgatory. However, a treatise opposing this practice has been found in [unrest_province.GetName] nailed to the door of one of our churches, which has a very substantial relic collection. Is there any truth to this treatise's complaints, or are they merely the words of naysayers and heretics seeking to harm the unity of the [GetInternationalOrganization('catholic_church').GetName], our one true path to salvation?"
 catholic_flavor.6.a: "But we just bought a vial of the milk of the Virgin Mary!"
 catholic_flavor.6.b: "Forgiveness can only come from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName]."
 catholic_flavor.6.b.tt: "This will make our population in [unrest_province.GetName] following [ShowReligionName('catholic')] unhappy."

 catholic_flavor.7.title: "Veneration of the Virgin Mary"
 catholic_flavor.7.desc: "The Blessed Virgin Mary, mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, is the Queen of Heaven and mediator of many graces. As the most perfect woman, her holy motherhood grants her a seat at the right hand of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName]. Or does it? Recently, radical theologians have been arguing that there is no need for such intercessions. Are they right, or is the Holy Mother Church in danger from their borderline heretical utterings?"
 catholic_flavor.7.a: "May the Madonna forgive them."
 catholic_flavor.7.b: "She is a special woman, but still just a woman."

 catholic_flavor.8.title: "The Doctrine of Particular Judgment"
 catholic_flavor.8.desc: "As we know, when we die, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] judges us immediately and decides what each soul's fate is to be as it awaits the final judgment.\n\nHowever, a monk in [unrest_province.GetName] has started a doctrinal dispute that verges on heresy, claiming that there is no purgatory and saying that prayers for the dead do not assist their passage into heaven.\n\nThese disputes are threatening the very unity of the [GetInternationalOrganization('catholic_church').GetName]."

 catholic_flavor.8.b: "The dead cannot be helped."

 catholic_flavor.9.title: "A New Confession of Faith"
 catholic_flavor.9.desc: "Reformers have put forward a new confession of faith that has some minor, but still serious, differences with [ShowReligionAdjective('catholic')] teachings. The [GetInternationalOrganization('catholic_church').GetName] claims it borders on the heretical, while there are those who suggest that this new confession would bring the [GetInternationalOrganization('catholic_church').GetNameWithNoTooltip] and its administrative apparatus under tighter control."
 catholic_flavor.9.a: "Promote it, even if some of our subjects stray too far."
 catholic_flavor.9.b: "Nay, it will damn everyone."

 catholic_flavor.10.desc: "A group of the so-called reforming monks has recently appeared at our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] under our most solemn promise of safe passage so that they might argue the justness of their cause.

 catholic_flavor.12.title: "Sublimis Deus"
 catholic_flavor.12.desc: "[pope_scope.GetName] decrees that the native peoples of the Colonies shall not be made into slaves. The belief that they are lesser brutes incapable of receiving [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName]'s grace, [pope_scope.GetSheHe] writes, is a vile lie spread by the enemy of the human race himself. Instead, His Holiness insists that, like all ensouled human beings, these people yearn for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName]'s light, and that therefore all pious princes should make haste to spread the [ShowReligionAdjective('catholic')] faith among them."
 catholic_flavor.12.a: "Enforce the [GetCountry('PAP').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s will."

 catholic_flavor.13.desc: "The [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('scriptorium')] in [target_location.GetName] has made a crucial mistake in the copying of some religious texts, implying an interpretation most heretical.

While we could continue in our old ways, the victories of [target_country.GetName] suggest that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] may truly be on the [ShowReligionAdjective('catholic')] side."

 catholic_flavor.15.title: "The Feast of Fools"
 catholic_flavor.15.desc: "The Feast of Fools is upon us!\n\nDressed in devilish clothes, a new 'bishop' has been elected. People drink, laugh, and dance as the false bishop makes a mockery of ecclesiastical rituals, a burlesque of [ShowReligionGroupName('christian')] worship that is fondly enjoyed by all except the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')], who are rather insistent that the festivities ought to be suspended at once for the sake of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] and country."
