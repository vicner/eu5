 pilgrimage_events.1.title: "Landslide"
 pilgrimage_events.1.desc: "During [target_ruler.GetHerHis] pilgrimage to [target_holy_site.GetName] in [target_location.GetName], [target_ruler.GetName] and [target_ruler.GetHerHis] retinue have found themselves quite an obstacle on the way. It seems that recent rains have loosened the soil around and produced a landslide, causing a significant damage to the settlements nearby. Paths have completely disappeared and houses have been washed away by the loose soil; plantation have been ruined and people have been left without means of survival. People come to [target_ruler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] to ask for help in rebuilding their livelihoods."
 pilgrimage_events.1.a: "Give them gold to ease their burden."
 pilgrimage_events.1.b: "Spare some men to help them rebuild."
 pilgrimage_events.1.c: "We are in a hurry, no time to stop for anything."
 pilgrimage_events.1.d: "We must stop and help these people."
 pilgrimage_events.1.d.tt: "The pilgrimage will take longer"

 pilgrimage_events.2.title: "A Wandering Monk"
 pilgrimage_events.2.desc: "The procession of [target_ruler.GetName] to [target_holy_site.GetName] in [target_location.GetName] has been briefly interrupted by a wandering monk on the side of the road asking for alms. [target_monk.GetName] claims to have been born and raised precisely in [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip], getting [target_monk.GetHerHis] [target_monk.GetReligion.GetAdjective] education in [target_holy_site.GetNameWithNoTooltip]. As such, [target_monk.GetSheHe] promises to guide [target_ruler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] in the mysteries of [target_monk.GetReligion.GetNameWithNoTooltip] if [target_ruler.GetSheHe] would allow [target_monk.GetHerHim] to accompany the procession."
 pilgrimage_events.2.a: "A holy [target_monk.GetWomanMan] is always welcome."
 pilgrimage_events.2.b: "Our current [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] advisors already have our trust."

 pilgrimage_events.3.title: "Free Rein at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle]"
 pilgrimage_events.3.desc: "While [target_ruler.GetName] is away on [target_ruler.GetHerHis] pilgrimage to [target_holy_site.GetName] in [target_location.GetName], many members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] are all but standing idle. Making use of the vacuum that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s absence has created, they have started scheming and plotting to gain more influence and power for themselves. When news of this reached [target_ruler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip], [target_ruler.GetSheHe] was left speechless, astonished that [target_ruler.GetHerHis] voice does not carry the same authority it once did."
 pilgrimage_events.3.a: "Traitors, all of them!"
 pilgrimage_events.3.b: "It is time to put them in place."
 pilgrimage_events.3.c: "They will rue these actions."
 pilgrimage_events.3.d: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s own [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle] was behind it!"

 pilgrimage_events.4.title: "[target_holy_site.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s Overcrowding"
 pilgrimage_events.4.desc: "When [target_ruler.GetName] arrived at [target_holy_site.GetName] in [target_location.GetName] [target_ruler.GetSheHe] could not believe what [target_ruler.GetSheHe] saw. What was supposed to be a center of faith and spirituality was instead more similar to a busy market square. The grounds were full to the brim with people coming from all over, while merchants had installed their stalls to profit from such a crowd. They were offering almost anything, from food and drinks for the pilgrims, to various paraphernalia to serve as proof of the visit. Some even had the gall to offer some supposed 'relics' inside the sacred ground itself. It was blatantly obvious that all those people were not devout pilgrims, but rabble attracted by the spectacle, while the actual pilgrims were like castaways in a sea of hedonism."
 pilgrimage_events.4.a: "Maybe we should take a look at the stalls too."
 pilgrimage_events.4.b: "Blasphemy! We must preserve the sacred grounds."
 pilgrimage_events.4.b.tt: "Every [pop|e] will lose [ShowNamedValue('pop_satisfaction_mild_penalty')|+=2%] [pop_satisfaction|e]"
 pilgrimage_events.4.c: "We will ensure its holiness ourselves, burn the stalls!"
 pilgrimage_events.4.c.tt: "Every [pop|e] will lose [ShowNamedValue('pop_satisfaction_severe_penalty')|+=2%] [pop_satisfaction|e]"

 pilgrimage_events.5.title: "Perilous Walk"
 pilgrimage_events.5.desc: "During [target_ruler.GetHerHis] pilgrimage to the holy site of [target_holy_site.GetName] in [target_location.GetName], [target_ruler.GetName] has had to walk on some difficult path. [target_ruler.GetSheHe|U] knew beforehand that a visit to such a mountainous place would not be an easy stroll, but the hardships of the trek have resulted more arduous than expected. Too steep and rocky for the horses to climb, the procession was forced to continue on foot, but the soil was slippery and treacherous. The fated time came, when [target_ruler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]'s footing failed, and [target_ruler.GetSheHe] tumbled down the mountainside. The resulting injuries are quite severe, and [target_ruler.GetSheHe] will need all medical attention our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] can provide as well as the favor of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] if [target_ruler.GetSheHe] is to recover from it."
 pilgrimage_events.5.a: "Gather the best healers."
 pilgrimage_events.5.a.tt: "[target_ruler.GetName] is injured and we call for the best healers to help [target_ruler.GetHerHim]"
 pilgrimage_events.5.b: "We can only pray."
 pilgrimage_events.5.b.tt: "[target_ruler.GetName] is injured and we pray to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] for [target_ruler.GetHerHis] recovery"
