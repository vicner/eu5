As with other boys of his age, he is expected to bring back his first prisoners soon, marking the start of his career as a warrior.\n\nShould any of the boys fail to take a captive, they will be forever marked as unfit to be warriors and will have to continue their days as men of little consequence."

 nahuatl_events.19.desc: "Battles between warriors are always individual affairs and it can be hard to keep track of exactly when or how each and every prisoner is taken. Recently, some warriors observed one of our most experienced fighters sneaking away with a captive of another warrior. If the prisoner was stolen then it is one of the gravest offenses possible for a warrior, punishable only by death.

Not only did the captive survive the first four encounters, but it almost looked as if he might have had a chance to beat the final, left-handed, opponent he then faced.\n\nAs it is customary, after the captive warrior was finally defeated, his heart was sacrificed to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] while his flesh was given to the captor's family to consume and his skin will be worn by the captor himself for many days.\n\nThe celebrations of this year's Tlācaxīpēhualiztli are likely to be remembered for years to come."

If there are, the Gods have arrived, and wind instruments are played and people offer balls of maize.\n\nAfter the Gods' arrival, captives are thrown into the fires and before they die they are taken out of it, their hearts are ripped out and they are beheaded. These captives, representing the #italic mīmixcōah#!, become stars in the sky after this celebration.\n\nGreat quantities of pulque are drunk as the month goes on in honor of Ōmetōchtli, the various Gods of pulque."
 nahuatl_events.310.desc.m: "The thirteenth month is the Festival of #italic Tepēilhuitl#! or 'the Mountain Feast', dedicated to the mountains Tlāloc, Popōcatepētl, and Iztaccihuatl. All along this month, we honor the Gods of trade, but also Tlāloc and Xōchiquetzal.\n\nOur people create a procession following the priests hiking to the nearest summits. In the temples erected on those summits, called #italic Āyauhcalli#! or 'Mist Houses,' the devotees leave their offerings to the Gods, and people feast until dusk in the mountains 'between clouds.'\n\nAmong the sacrifices, children are given to Tlāloc as is custom, and a representation of Xōchiquetzal is also sacrificed to the Gods."
 nahuatl_events.310.desc.n: "In The Festival of #italic Quechōlli#!, or 'Roseate Spoonbill,' hunting is the main theme, and the month is dedicated to the God Mixcōhuātl, the Cloud Serpent God of the hunt. It is during these dry months that hunting becomes an important part of our culture.\n\nAs part of the celebrations, ritual hunting is carried out, as well as sacrifices of slaves and captives. It is also the month where we replenish our armories and new weapons are made. All the participants in these celebrations practice bloodletting to honor the animals that we will hunt, giving blood for blood, or our people dead in battles."
 nahuatl_events.310.desc.o: "The Festival of #italic Panquetzaliztli#!, or 'Raising of Banners,' is the fifteenth month of our calendar and marks the birth of Huītzilōpōchtli.\n\nDuring this month, there is a big festival celebrating the birth of the God, at the end of which several slaves and captives are sacrificed, and whose owners abstain from almost eating until the month is over. As it is a martial-oriented month, ritual battles are fought.\n\nA figure representing the God is also created with [ShowGoodsName('maize')] that is eaten after the sacrifices. Throughout the month, there is a significant consumption of pulque, and people offer their blood to the God as a sacrifice."
 nahuatl_events.310.desc.p: "This is the sixteenth month of the year or #italic Ātemoztli#!, which means 'Descent of Water', and is devoted to Tlāloc, the God of Rain.\n\nDuring this month, we pray for adequate rain to nourish our fields and ensure a bountiful harvest, while effigies of the God made with [ShowGoodsName('maize')] dough are consumed. As a sacrifice, besides captives and slaves, children are drowned in the lake or the mountains as offerings."
 nahuatl_events.310.desc.q: "As the year approaches its end, we celebrate the Festival of #italic Tititl#!, 'Stretching.' This festivity honors Cihuacōātl, and during it, the Goddess is called Ilamahtēuctli, or 'the Old Woman,' as the Earth has dried out, and she is the fertile mother of us all.\n\nIn the ceremony, a representation of the Goddess made of amaranth is ritualistically sacrificed. As she dries, she becomes masculine, displaying the dualistic nature of the world.\n\nOld people enjoy this month dedicated in many ways to them, but everyone dances and participates in fertility rituals. Merchants will also sacrifice slaves bought specifically for this celebration."
 nahuatl_events.310.desc.r: "The last month of the year, 'Rebirth,' or #italic Izcalli#!, marks the end of our calendar, just before the feared Nēmontēmi days. These days are dedicated to the Gods Tlāloc and Xiuhtēcuhtli, in hopes that they bring the fertility our fields need to feed our people.\n\nDuring the Festival, tamales made of amaranth are profusely consumed, and youngsters go hunting beasts in the forests or birds in the lake, while the fires in the temples and homes are extinguished. These fires will only be reignited in the presence of the Deity. As with all festivities, sacrifices of slaves and captives dressed as the deities are performed."
 nahuatl_events.310.desc.s: "We are in the last five days of the year, collectively known as the Nēmontēmi. During these days, our people do not celebrate anything as they are considered unlucky days; no business is conducted, and people practice abstinence as a sign of respect to the #italic Tzitzimime#!.\n\nWhile during the rest of the year, our people worship them as the protectresses of the feminine and progenitresses of mankind, during the days of the Nēmontēmi, as an unstable period of the year, they are feared.\n\nRegardless, [target_character.GetName], has dared to host a celebration. Attendance at the event has been minimal, as most people fear a catastrophe or, at the very least, that attending such a festivity during the unlucky days could bring bad luck to them and their families. Despite the advice of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')], our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has turned a deaf ear and proceeded with the preparations. Will the deities punish us?"
 nahuatl_events.310.a: "Improve the celebration massively."
 nahuatl_events.310.b: "Improve the celebration greatly."
 nahuatl_events.310.c: "Nevermind."
