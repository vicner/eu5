 confucian_events.1.title: "Concept of Shàngdì"
 confucian_events.1.desc: "The followers of the [target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetAdjective] faith in [target_location.GetName] have increasingly come to integrate our rites and concepts from [ShowPolicyName('confucianism_policy')] in their daily life. A recent trend is to identify the concept of Shàngdì with their own supreme deities. This interpretation is somewhat unorthodox to the scholar experts of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], but it has allowed the [target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] faithful to integrate a number of concepts, rites, constants, and classical teachings from [ShowPolicyNameWithNoTooltip('confucianism_policy')] into their theology.\n\nHowever, there is still some debate in the palace halls of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], whether this is the right and proper way on the path for the [target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetNameWithNoTooltip] adherents to better be integrated into our bureaucracy."
 confucian_events.1.a: "We must teach them the proper ways!"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_shangdi_conflict_refused: "Shàngdì Conflict Refused"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_shangdi_conflict_refused: "We are not allowing people to identify the concept of Shàngdì to some of their own previous beliefs. As a result, it is more difficult for them to comprehend our own systems."
 confucian_events.1.b: "Let us accommodate this abstraction."
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_shangdi_conflict_accepted: "Shàngdì Conflict Accepted"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_shangdi_conflict_accepted: "The concept of Shàngdì has been easily interpreted as some of the people's previous beliefs. As a result, they have an easier time comprehending our own systems."

 confucian_events.2.title: "Translations of the Classics"
 confucian_events.2.desc: "Believers of the [target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetAdjective] faith in [target_location.GetName] are a people with strong traditions and rites, and their adherence to the language of their own teachings is holding them back from progressing towards civilization. If they are to ever elevate themselves from the barbarian of this world and really become integrated into our society, we must perhaps ensure that the classics and the proper rites are available for them to digest in their own language.\n\nThere are some scholars that have already begun to create such works, but others firmly oppose such an endeavor. Should we encourage them to continue synthesizing their old religious concepts with the sublime principles of Kǒng Fūzǐ?"
 confucian_events.2.a: "Let them create their own version of proper form."
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_classics_translated: "Classics Translated"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_classics_translated: "We allow people to translate the classic teaching of [ShowPolicyName('confucianism_policy')] to their own languages, making them better instructed in the process."
 confucian_events.2.b: "This would be a travesty on our ideology!"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_classics_defended: "Classics Defended"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_classics_defended: "We do not allow the classic teachings to be subverted by being translated into foreign languages. Their purity is what keeps the gears of our bureaucracy turning."

 confucian_events.3.title: "Faith of [target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 confucian_events.3.desc: "Our trusted [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCabinetMemberTitle] and confidant, [target_character.GetName], has worked closely with our [target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetAdjective] community in [target_location.GetName] in order to help them elevate their barbarian culture. Surprised at [target_character.GetHerHis] findings, [target_character.GetSheHe] has started to adopt many [target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] concepts after studying their science and literature intensely. Many worry that [target_character.GetSheHe] has gotten too taken in by [target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] ways. Some even claim that our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCabinetMemberTitle] has secretly converted, shaming [target_character.GetHerHis] ancestors and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] alike."
 confucian_events.3.a: "Depose this [target_character.GetWomanMan]!"
 confucian_events.3.b: "We have much to learn from the [target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] people."
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_converted_minister: "Scholar [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCabinetMemberTitle]"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_converted_minister: "One member of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCabinetTitle] has been seduced by a foreign religion. Although that damages our faith, the benefits from other sources of knowledge cannot be easily ignored."

 confucian_events.4.title: "Rights and Rite"
 confucian_events.4.desc: "While they are part of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], some [target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetAdjective] traditions can be very hard to stomach. Civilized people are supposed to abide by what is right and logical according to the teachings of [ShowPolicyName('confucianism_policy')], but these men and women have many customs in direct contradiction to such rules. Our officials in [target_location.GetName] have been struggling with the locals who insist on their barbarous ways."
 confucian_events.4.a: "Barbarians!"
 confucian_events.4.b: "Such minor things do not concern us."

 confucian_events.5.title: "Empowering the Office of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]"
 confucian_events.5.desc: "While the [target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetAdjective] people are barbarians, they have some customs and rites that we might make use of. As their traditions and ceremonies regarding rulership already contain a concept of a high worldly power such as our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], this is something we could make good use of. Local officials in [target_location.GetName] have already been doing so, but it has been suggested that we make use of [target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] ceremonies even at higher levels. Others argue that we would be shaming our ancestors and turning our back on what is proper if we allowed these traditions to contaminate ours."
 confucian_events.5.a: "This does not sound too bad."
 confucian_events.5.b: "It is the shameful officials we need to deal with!"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_local_rites_represed: "Local Rites Repressed"

 confucian_events.6.title: "Bringing Civilization to the Barbarians"
 confucian_events.6.desc: "Over time, the [target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetAdjective] people have come to take to many of our customs. When our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCabinetMemberTitle] [target_character.GetName] visited the area of [target_location.GetName], [target_character.GetSheHe] found that they are still far from civilized, however. When a local influential landholder invited [target_character.GetHerHim] to participate in a naming ceremony for his son in which he named the boy after himself, that was the final straw.\n\n[target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip] returned from the area with a very low opinion of the [target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] people and of their prospects to ever count themselves among the civilized people of the world."
 confucian_events.6.a: "We will leave them to their own devices then."
 confucian_events.6.b: "Let us send our best and brightest to civilize them."

 confucian_events.7.title: "[target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] Civilization"
 confucian_events.7.desc: "Some barbarians are more susceptible to reason and intellect than others. The [target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetAdjective] people of [target_location.GetName] have already taken to many of our traditions, from the more important to even minor things. Visiting foreigners have a hard time telling the region apart from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] proper as, except for some minor eccentricities, the people and customs there seem as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] as any part of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip]."
 confucian_events.7.a: "Progress!"
 confucian_events.7.b: "We must use this opportunity regionally!"

 confucian_events.8.title: "Xiăorén?"
 confucian_events.8.desc: "The rule of our great [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] is the foremost responsibility and privilege of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]. The members of the [target_ruler.GetDynasty.GetName] dynasty have in the past prided themselves on leading through example, observing strict etiquette, personal austerity, and carefully weeding out those that do not conform to this ideal.\n\nIt is therefore with a heavy heart that [target_ruler.GetName] has observed the development of [target_heir.GetName]. Far from an ideal [target_heir.GetWomanMan], our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle] is often described by [target_heir.GetHerHis] teachers as a petty [target_heir.GetWomanMan], focused on immediate gain and emotional pleasures. There are, however, factions at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] that would be most dismayed if we abandoned [target_heir.GetHerHim], and a new [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle] would not have their support."
 confucian_events.8.a: "Such a [target_heir.GetWomanMan] is not fit for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
 confucian_events.8.b: "We must not upset the current balance."

 confucian_events.9.title: "Popular Novel"
 confucian_events.9.desc: "A vernacular novel about a well-known story from the past is rapidly gaining popularity among our subjects. This in itself is not a problem but it has come to our attention that this novelization is in fact breaking central tenets of [ShowPolicyName('confucianism_policy')], as it could be seen as an argument for disobeying the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] and the central authority.\n\nOur administrators now argue that the book must be banned, though some fear this will only make it more alluring to those that wish to read it."
 confucian_events.9.a: "It must be banned immediately."
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_banned_novel: "Banned Novel"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_banned_novel: "Subversive novels contradicting the principles of [ShowPolicyName('confucianism_policy')] must never be allowed in our country."
 confucian_events.9.b: "We lead by example, not decree. Let it be."
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_allowed_critical_novel: "Allowed Critical Novel"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_allowed_critical_novel: "A novel very critical with our rule has been allowed to spread around. Although it does not paint us in the best way, it is a relief that our populace is reading some books for a change."

 confucian_events.10.title: "Civil Service"
 confucian_events.10.desc: "Education, self-improvement, and adherence to the classics are the backbone of any government based on [ShowPolicyName('confucianism_policy')] and if our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] is to aspire to greatness, we must at all times devote money, attention, and energy to ensuring that our officials are as well-educated and well-informed as they can possibly be. It is therefore of some concern that the number of people seeking government employment seems to be decreasing as of late."
 confucian_events.10.a: "We must expand the bureaucracy!"
 confucian_events.10.b: "There is no need to reinforce the cadres just yet."

 confucian_events.11.title: "Moral Guidance in an Era of Turmoil"
 confucian_events.11.desc: "Many of the leading figures in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are either self-made men or depend on the loyalty of those who are. Our old moral codes, however, press the importance of lineage and loyalty and a social order based around obedience to the authority of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]. Scholars of [ShowPolicyName('confucianism_policy')] are now exploring the teachings of the great masters and revising them for guidance in the governance of our country.\n\nThis newfound interest in Neo-Confucianism emphasizes the original values of morality and learning over the extreme focus on correct governance of later scholars, and attempts to give a rational moral code for local rulers and ordinary men alike. One of such scholars is [target_character.GetName], who has made a name for [target_character.GetHerselfHimself] among the educated elites."
 confucian_events.11.a: "We should strive to attract people like [target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 confucian_events.11.b: "Let us patronize the institutions of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."

 confucian_events.12.title: "Birth and Privilege"
 confucian_events.12.desc: "The spread of the ideals of [ShowPolicyName('confucianism_policy')] in our society has led to a number of men of humble origins rising to positions of intellectual influence. [target_character.GetName], one of the more prominent scholars of this age, is [target_character.GetHerselfHimself] not born from the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')], and along with other scholars [target_character.GetSheHe] is intent on making learning more widely available through public lectures and books written in simple language.\n\nIn many ways, this is a challenge to the old social order, where learning was a privilege reserved for the families of the right lineages."
 confucian_events.12.a: "This is an initiative we must support."
 confucian_events.12.b: "We cannot allow social order to be threatened in this way!"

 confucian_events.13.title: "Meritocracy"
 confucian_events.13.desc: "From a young age, [target_ruler.GetName] has been studying the texts of of [ShowPolicyName('confucianism_policy')] and listening to Neo-Confucian lectures. As the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], [target_ruler.GetSheHe] now has the ability to put many of these philosophical principles to work. An ambitious scheme would be to root out those of little competence who hold influence in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] solely on the basis of birth and the ancient ties of loyalty between our families.\n\nOf course, our loyal vassals would likely see this as ingratitude and unwarranted hostility."
 confucian_events.13.a: "Merit should be the guiding principle."
 confucian_events.13.b: "We must support those loyal to us."
