 muslim_school_events.1.title: "A Talented Judge"
 muslim_school_events.1.desc: "Acquiring an education in theology and law is often a long process involving studying classical works of law, under the tutelage of the $rank_county_arabic_ruler_male$ of various [ShowBuildingTypeName('madrasa')]. For every work or commentary learned, the student acquires a certificate, an 'Ijāza. Depending on what [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('madrasa')], and which $rank_county_arabic_ruler_male$, the worth of the 'Ijāza may not necessarily be the same.\n\nThe [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('madrasa')] in [mufti_province.GetName] has lately been making a very good impression in around the country, no doubt students from there have a great career as a Qāḍī or Muftī ahead of them."
 muslim_school_events.1.a: "We are in need of a new Qāḍī."
 muslim_school_events.1.b: "A Muftī in our capital will bring legal guidance."
 muslim_school_events.2.title: "The $common_string_shaikh_al_islam$"
 muslim_school_events.2.desc: "Where the Qāḍī are the judges of the land, the Muftī are the ones to provide general legal interpretation and doctrine. A [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetGovernmentType.GetName] as large as ours, however, needs an overarching authority over all Muftī. Traditionally this is the role of the $common_string_shaikh_al_islam$.\n\nThe $common_string_shaikh_al_islam$ will not only author Fatwā himself, he will also be the one to appoint many of the regional Muftī in our realm, and ultimately he is the person who will safeguard the legality of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s edicts. Naturally the man we pick will belong to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligiousSchool.GetName] but there are a number of distinguished candidates to choose from."
 muslim_school_events.2.a: "Let us elect the foremost and most loyal Muftī to this position"
 muslim_school_events.2.b: "The most learned and steadfast candidate must be named $common_string_shaikh_al_islam$."
 muslim_school_events.2.c: "A famous Sufi will give this office the dignity it deserves."
 muslim_school_events.3.title: "New [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('madrasa')]"
 muslim_school_events.3.desc: "Prominent citizens of [madrassah_province.GetProvince.GetName] have made a number of charitable donations for the establishment of a new [ShowBuildingTypeName('madrasa')] in [madrassah_province.GetName]. They have invited scholars not only from the wider [madrassah_province.GetProvince.GetNameWithNoTooltip] but also from other parts of our territory, and even foreign theologians."
 muslim_school_events.3.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('common_string_positive')]"
 muslim_school_events.4.title: "Ġuzāt"
 muslim_school_events.4.desc: "For centuries, wars to expand the faith has seen groups of 'Ġuzāt', or holy warriors on the frontiers of Islam, raiding enemy lands and bolstering the ranks of the faithful. Our war against the infidel [SCOPE.sCountry('infidel').GetAdjective] has attracted the attention of such warriors. They have come to join our ranks to prove their worth as holy warriors, and perhaps for the promise of loot as well."
 muslim_school_events.4.a: "They are welcome."
 muslim_school_events.5.title: "Custodianship of [SCOPE.sLocation('holy_city').GetName]"
 muslim_school_events.5.desc: "With each year the holy city of [SCOPE.sLocation('holy_city').GetName] has seen an increase in the number of pilgrims that seek the shrines there. The faithful come from all corners of the Islamic world, bringing commerce, goods, capital, news and ideas from faraway places to our ports."
 muslim_school_events.5.a: "God is Good."
 muslim_school_events.6.title: "Shiite Migration"
 muslim_school_events.6.desc: "While Shiism is widespread in the Islamic world, most Shiites live in lands ruled by Sunni or even non-muslim states. In order to survive, our brothers of faith often have to adopt a policy of Taqiyya, deliberately pretending to distance themselves from the Shia faith. As one of few Shia [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetGovernmentType.GetName]s we have come to attract members of faith who no longer want to live out their spiritual lives in secrecy. Many of them are both learned and productive members of society."
 muslim_school_events.6.a: "Let us welcome them into our cities."
 muslim_school_events.6.b: "Let us send them forth to populate the frontier."
 muslim_school_events.7.title: "Sufi Syncretism"
 muslim_school_events.7.desc: "Sufis, with their mystical and less legalistic approach to Islam, are often more welcome among the heathen than the highly educated [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] or soldiers of the faith. Manifesting piety in other ways such as dance, singing and by blending the Islamic traditions with local ones, the Sufis are not always at the best term with the religious establishment.\nA sufi leader has managed to get quite a following in [SCOPE.sLocation('sufi_province').GetName], with a great number of [SCOPE.sLocation('sufi_province').GetDominantReligion.GetName] converts joining his disciples. His followers are clearing land for new settlements where they might live together and this could well lead to a much greater Islamic influence in the entire area. Many among the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] are asking that we send him on his way, as they fear he is leading the true faithful astray and blurring the line between Islam and the [SCOPE.sLocation('sufi_province').GetDominantReligion.GetName] faith."
 muslim_school_events.7.a: "He is doing God's work."
 muslim_school_events.7.b: "He will have to do his preaching elsewhere."
 muslim_school_events.8.title: "Foreign Theologians Enliven Scholarship"
 muslim_school_events.8.desc: "The theologians we invited to our country have come to greatly enrich local religious scholarship. They have left their mark upon our country and inspired a new generation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')]."
 muslim_school_events.8.a: "I have need of them in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]."
 muslim_school_events.8.b: "They will find their places throughout our country."
 muslim_school_events.9.title: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scholar_country').GetReligiousSchool.GetNameWithNoTooltip] Theologians"
 muslim_school_events.9.desc: "By giving [SCOPE.sCountry('scholar_country').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] scholars in our Madrasahs we are not only improving the theological discussion in our country but also improving our ties with the [SCOPE.sCountry('scholar_country').GetName] [SCOPE.sCountry('scholar_country').GetGovernment.GetGovernmentType.GetName]."
 muslim_school_events.9.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('common_string_positive')]"
 academic_respect: "Mutual Respect"
 muslim_school_events.10.title: "Religious Scholars Disagree"
 muslim_school_events.10.desc: "Not all theologians agree. Normally this is not much of a problem, as disagreement can exist without problem in the scholarly world. Sometimes disagreements take on a more personal form however, some would argue that's how our invited scholars came to be at odds with much of our religious establishment, causing much harm to our international reputation."
 muslim_school_events.10.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('common_string_negative')]"
 muslim_school_events.11.title: "Playing the Courts"
 muslim_school_events.11.desc: "While the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligiousSchool.GetName] school is the officially sanctioned school of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], there are many courts and Qāḍī throughout our lands and all of the schools of faith are deemed appropriate for civil procedures. This means that to some extent it is possible to 'play the courts' by bringing a case before a Qāḍī of a school considered more likely to give a beneficial ruling to a specific case.\n\nAn entrepreneuring merchant in [selected_location.GetName] has become so good at this that it has angered not only the local population and his business competitors, but also the local governor. There is not much we can do about this without making inroads into the privileges of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')]."
 muslim_school_events.11.a: "Let us just ensure that this man is dealt with."
 muslim_school_events.11.b: "Pragmatism must come before theology."
 muslim_school_events.12.title: "Taqiyya"
 muslim_school_events.12.desc: "For centuries, many of the followers of Ali have considered it a necessity to hide themselves and feign adherence to other religious customs in order to keep their faith alive. Authorities in [SCOPE.sLocation('shia_here').GetName] have increasingly come to suspect that there is an increasing number of Shias among the local sufi lodges, and would like our blessing in their attempts to ROOT them out."
 muslim_school_events.12.a: "We cannot tolerate heretics!"
 muslim_school_events.12.b: "We must respect the Sufi lodges."
 10_percent_of_all_pops_become_shia_tt: "#Y 10%#! of our [pops|e] in this [location|e] will convert to [ShowReligionName('shia')]"
 muslim_school_events.13.title: "Protests in [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 muslim_school_events.13.desc: "As men of great spiritual strength, but also firmly part of the establishment, members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] sometimes choose to join social protests. A recent altercation between the local garrison and the urban population in [target_location.GetName] has attracted the attention of prominent Muftī in the state of [target_location.GetProvince.GetName].\n\nOur local commander fears the situation might escalate unless we listen to the protesters, but doing so would come at a cost."
 muslim_school_events.13.a: "Let us compensate the people of [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 muslim_school_events.13.b: "Muftī or not, there is nothing we can do."
 muslim_school_events.14.title: "The poor of [SCOPE.sLocation('urbanization_province').GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 muslim_school_events.14.desc: "As cities grow, the old amenities and walls that once supported them decay. In [SCOPE.sLocation('urbanization_province').GetName] this has over time led to change. Less clean workshops, such as those of tanners, have moved beyond the city walls, as have the cemeteries. Most visible, however, is the increasing number of poor in the streets. As existing charities have not been able to keep up with the rapid growth of the city, it has been suggested that we set aside more state property as Waqf, charitable donations for the upkeep of public soup kitchens and bath houses."
 muslim_school_events.14.a: "We will naturally support such a cause."
 muslim_school_events.14.b: "Surely local notables can afford charity out of their own pockets?"
 muslim_school_events.15.title: "The City of [holy_city.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 muslim_school_events.15.desc: "As Custodians of the holy mosques of [holy_city.GetName], we are not only responsible for the Holy Shrine. A state that claims this honor is also expected to fend for both the population of the holy cities, as well as the pilgrims they attract. For this purpose, many rulers have devoted great resources, both within the cities themselves and large tracts of faraway farmland, in order to feed and maintain the area.\n\nSome say [target_ruler.GetName] has not been paying the attention to these cities that they deserve, that pilgrims are no longer safe and that there is great want in the streets of [holy_city.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 muslim_school_events.15.a: "Let us set aside more land for their upkeep."
 muslim_school_events.15.b: "Sadly we have no more resources to spare right now."
 muslim_school_events.16.title: "Expansion of the [madrasa_province.GetNameWithNoTooltip] Madrasah"
 muslim_school_events.16.desc: "The Madrasah of [madrasa_province.GetName] has been gaining repute, not only as a center of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligiousSchool.GetName] learning, but also for its Shuyūkh from other schools. [inv_school.GetName] scholars from other parts of the world have in particular made a name for themselves at the [madrasa_province.GetNameWithNoTooltip] Madrasah and as a result, both the institution itself, the adjoining market district, and the bustling city as a whole are growing rapidly.\n\nUrban growth is never without its problems, however, and a growing Madrasah still needs to be provided for. If [target_ruler.GetName] [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] would set aside a larger charitable donation for the upkeep and maintenance of a greater Madrasah, it would benefit both the city and the area at large."
 muslim_school_events.16.a: "We must contribute to this endeavor."
 muslim_school_events.16.b: "The locals can feed and pay for them."
 muslim_school_events.17.title: "Dargah"
 muslim_school_events.17.desc: "A Sufi $rank_county_arabic_ruler_male$ has passed away in [dargah_province.GetName] and his followers are now putting up a shrine in his honor. Pilgrims from various parts of the country are already starting to come to the province to see the shrine of this great man, some calling him a saint. Local notables have set aside a charitable donation for its maintenance and his former pupils have opened a lodge nearby.\nWhile there is nothing wrong with honoring a great man, some more traditionalists among the pious and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] feel that this form of worship is sacrilegious.\nShould [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] pay the shrine in [dargah_province.GetNameWithNoTooltip] a visit it might do much, both for the prestige of the shrine itself but also for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerHis] popular perception."
 muslim_school_events.17.a: "Let us seek guidance at this holy place."
 muslim_school_events.17.b: "We must not feed into local superstition."
 muslim_school_events.18.title: "Alevis of [alevi_province.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 muslim_school_events.18.desc: "While they are not our direct brothers of faith, a great number among the Turkic tribesmen in Anatolia are Shia Alevis. Like the Jafari's the Alevis are twelvers and believe in the coming of the Twelve Imām. Their faith is also quite deeply entrenched in mysticism and Sufism. Under Sunni rule they have been forced to live a life in many ways secluded from society, they have not been allowed to intermarry the Sunnis and they have been distrusted by the state.\nMany among the people of [alevi_province.GetName] are Alevis and they have generally welcomed us as their new overlords. Their mystical traditions are in many ways different from ours but if we embraced these people we could likely spread the Shia faith much more quickly in the area."
 muslim_school_events.18.a: "Let us empower our brothers of faith in the area."
 muslim_school_events.18.b: "While we welcome them, administration will remain in the hands of local authorities."
 muslim_school_events.19.title: "The Worldly [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')]"
 muslim_school_events.19.desc: "Not all members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] are great theologians or intellectuals. Corruption can grow in any corner of the state and for some, it can be hard to tell apart what benefits the faith and what might benefit themselves. It has come to the attention of [target_ruler.GetName] that a number of pious grants that exist around the empire have been obtained through fraud or illegally passed on to heirs. Members of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] have suggested that we inspect and verify all such grants in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], especially in regions that were not originally ruled by us.\n\nThis would clearly be a grave affront to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')], however, who would see it as an encroachment on their privileges and an attack on their caste as a whole."
 muslim_school_events.19.a: "A few transgressions are nothing compared to what these men give us."
 muslim_school_events.19.b: "Only traitors have anything to fear."
 muslim_school_events.21.title: "Neo Sufism & Traditionalist Reaction"
 muslim_school_events.21.desc: "Many among the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] are increasingly unhappy with the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]. Among pious Muslims, our inclusion of heathens in high offices as well as the adoption of heathen customs and traditions, is viewed with scorn. The intrusions of the state on interpretation of law and other traditional domains of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] have also not earned the state any friends among the jurists of the realm.\nCharismatic $rank_county_arabic_ruler_male$ of the Sufi Naqshbandi order have begun to agitate against the state what they consider a wrongful, and in some cases sinful implementation of Islamic law in our realm."
 muslim_school_events.21.a: "They are sadly misguided."
 muslim_school_events.21.a.tt: "From now on the religious establishment will react more strongly to impious conduct of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]"
 muslim_school_events.22.title: "[ShowReligiousSchoolNameWithNoTooltip('wahhabi_school')]"
 muslim_school_events.22.desc: "A growing movement among the [ShowReligiousSchoolName('hanbali_school')] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] is advocating a return to a purer faith. They strongly oppose any innovations to the prophets customs, and anything that is not part of the literary sources of Islamic Law. Strongly opposing all forms of Sufism, saint worship, or Non-Islamic traditions, they promise to bring a truer religious society to all who embrace their teachings."
 muslim_school_events.22.a: "Interesting."
 muslim_school_events.22.a.tt: "[ShowReligiousSchoolName('wahhabi_school')] [religious_school|e] is now enabled"
 muslim_school_events.22.b: "They are right."
 muslim_school_events.23.title: "Sufi Shrines"
 muslim_school_events.23.desc: "The practice to patronize or even provide for shrines connected to the tombs of famous Sufis has long been a major point of contention for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')]. With a more traditionalist generation taking power they are now placing pressure on our ruler to try to clamp down on this custom."
 muslim_school_events.23.a: "We must do as they ask."
 muslim_school_events.23.b: "No. The old masters were great men!"
