Even though she was subsequently imprisoned and tortured, Maxentius failed yet again, as many of his closest subjects were converted by Catherine's eloquence and piousness.

 miaphysite_flavor.20.title: "The Importance of Higher Learning"
 miaphysite_flavor.20.desc: "The monasteries of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetGovernmentType.GetName] are famed as centers of learning and art. At each monastic school reside a number of religious scholars, experts within fields such as Church history, exegesis of the Holy Scripture, reading, grammar, poetry, music, calligraphy, and painting. The monasteries compete to attract the most learned masters and maintain them with great honor and monetary compensation. In return, the scholars pass on their knowledge to their students, which consist of potential clergymen as well as ambitious nobles. To join the Christian elite, being part of a powerful family is rarely enough - everyone who has a significant role in the running of our country has been educated at one of the most prestigious monastic schools.\n\nWe have been contacted by two of these schools and they are asking for our support. If we choose to offer our patronage, it could be beneficial for the scholarly development of the nation."
 miaphysite_flavor.20.a: "We shall support the school which specializes in administration."

 miaphysite_flavor.30.desc: "A few religious conversations here, some impressive arguments about the morality of man there, and one of our most learned noblemen has decided to take up a monastic life. 'I shall follow in the footsteps of Saint Shenoute the Archimandrite - one day I might even found a monastery of my own!' he exclaims passionately.\nNot everyone would agree with this nobleman's decision, however, and even though he has already started giving away his belongings, there might still be time to talk the man out of going."

The foundations of the stone walls were set over a millennium ago and the devout worshipers in the area long for nothing more than to restore the building to its former glory. 'With your aid, it will once again become a center of higher learning and scripture studies,' they assure us."

 miaphysite_flavor.32.desc: "We have received word from [pious_province.GetName] of a group of commoners gathering in the countryside at regular intervals. It appears they are worshipers of the Lord.

 miaphysite_flavor.33.desc: "We are proud to be Miaphysites, followers of the true faith. However, while we are firm in our convictions and will never abandon Christ, being isolated from the rest of the Christian community is a weakness. We are beset by religious enemies on many fronts. The impending war is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when. Before it breaks out, we should try to seek powerful allies. There is a mighty Christian realm far to the north, but its exact location and the distance to their lands are unknown to us. However, we can fund an expedition with the goal of finding it."
 miaphysite_flavor.33.a: "Send a party of our best explorers, priests, and diplomats!"

Our advisors suspect that they are trying to make contact with other Christians to the north. The diplomats are worryingly tight-lipped on the subject of their purpose. Perhaps it is simply a religious matter, but what if they are attempting to gather allies against us? We would be beset on multiple fronts by fanatical infidels!"

They will neither be persuaded to let our people continue on their journey nor to return the diplomats back home. We can only hope that they change their minds.

 miaphysite_flavor.36.title: "Brothers From Across the Sea"
 miaphysite_flavor.36.desc: "Sometimes we are reminded of how far this world extends beyond our own realms. We have been visited by a strange group of people from lands far south of here. While most of them only speak their own peculiar-sounding language, a few of them have conversed with our translators in Arabic. They claim to come from the great [sent_diplomats.GetGovernment.GetGovernmentType.GetName] of [sent_diplomats.GetName] and that they seek friends among their fellow Christians. We have very little knowledge of the Christians in the south, but these [sent_diplomats.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] men seem to be genuine believers. They speak of Christ with fervor and seem far more well-versed in the scripture than our own average noble. Apparently their country is surrounded by religious enemies, and they ask us to aid them in defending the true faith. While this conflict is too distant and unknown for us to become engaged directly, we could share some of our knowledge and resources with them."
 miaphysite_flavor.36.a: "Of course we will help you, brothers. Anything for the one true God!"
 miaphysite_flavor.36.a.tt: "The [sent_diplomats.GetAdjective] diplomats are sent home with some resources to aid them in their defense of Christianity."

 miaphysite_flavor.37.desc: "Praise the Lord, our diplomats have finally returned from their journey to the north! Not only are they with us again, safe and sound, but they also bring many interesting tomes and tales from their travels. Most come from the [faraway_catholic.GetGovernment.GetGovernmentType.GetName] of [faraway_catholic.GetName], where our diplomats were very well received. While we might have hoped for more than knowledge, we are thankful for whatever God and our fellow Christians provide us with. We will make sure that their gift does not go to waste."
 miaphysite_flavor.37.a: "Perhaps this is the start of a lasting friendship between our nations?"
 miaphysite_flavor.38.title: "Alone in the World"
 miaphysite_flavor.38.desc: "After a long and arduous journey, the diplomats whom we sent northwards have finally returned. They did indeed reach Christian lands in the end, yet they came back empty-handed. While many of the Christians they encountered listened, few seemed to truly care. In our isolation, we are doubly cursed. Not only are we surrounded by enemies, but the distance to the rest of the Christian community makes us outcasts. What happens in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] does not influence them and perhaps our ways are too foreign for them to relate to. It seems as if the Miaphysites are alone in the world."
 miaphysite_flavor.38.a: "We cannot lose faith. God is the only ally we need."
