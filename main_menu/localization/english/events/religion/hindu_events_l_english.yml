 hindu_events.2100.title: "The Four Kumāra"
 hindu_events.2100.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is without a potential [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle]. [target_ruler.GetDynasty.GetName]'s rule of the nation may slip if [target_ruler.GetName] passes on without a successor, and the pressure to produce an heir weighs heavily on [target_ruler.GetHerHim]. Daily prayers for the Gods to give [target_ruler.GetHerHim] a child remain unanswered, but one story is on everyone's minds.\n\nOnce, Brahmā the Creator brought forth from his body four sons, the Kumāra, to carry on his legacy and aid him in creation. However, the Kumāra refused such worldly tasks and dedicated themselves solely to learning and teaching the divine. Without their devotion and celibacy, knowledge of [ShowGodName('vishnu_god')] would not reach us.\n\nIf we wish to please Lord [ShowGodNameWithNoTooltip('vishnu_god')], [target_ruler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] must cast aside the desire for an heir, motivated by a hunger for power and carnal desires, and seek the truth."
 hindu_events.2100.a: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will devote [target_ruler.GetHerHis] life to purity and [ShowGodNameWithNoTooltip('vishnu_god')]."
 hindu_events.2100.b: "We will heed the advice, but duty cannot be forsaken."

 hindu_events.2101.desc: "Years have passed since [target_ruler.GetName] abandoned attempts to produce an heir for [target_ruler.GetHerHis] dynasty for a life in celibacy devoted to Vedic study. What may happen when [target_ruler.GetHerHis] passes on is uncertain, but [target_ruler.GetHerHis] dedication does not waver. Stepping outside the life of a regular [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], [target_ruler.GetSheHe] can understand the Kumāra and their decision to know and spread the knowledge of [ShowGodName('vishnu_god')]."

Knowing that [ShowGodName('ganesha_god')] values wisdom, it pleases our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] that the nation has been successful in the search for it.\n\nYet at the same time, the more we advance, the more obstacles we find impeding our research. Lord [ShowGodNameWithNoTooltip('ganesha_god')], who creates and shifts the obstructive elements of the world, may not only aid our studies, but also make them more difficult."

[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s superiority had turned its elite, including the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], vain and conceited. We now see that true wisdom requires humility. The difficulties now behind us, as well as those that lie ahead, are the very challenges which provide that wisdom."
