 patriarch_events.1.title: "The Saints of [local_saint_state_province.GetProvince.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 patriarch_events.1.desc: "There is great uncertainty in the see of [local_saint_state_province.GetProvince.GetName]. While we are united in faith, the people of the state, including many of the local priests, are refusing to participate in the feasts and celebrations of saints that are customary within our borders. They claim that these are not canonical and that they will observe the religious customs of their own ancestors, including the veneration of a number of suspect saints from the area."
 patriarch_events.1.a: "We must enforce the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] saints and feasts."
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_saints_enforced: "Religious Conformance"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_saints_enforced: "We have forced the population in this location to adhere to our own religious customs at the cost of them highly resenting our rule. Over time it will, however, allow us to better integrate them into our society."
 patriarch_events.1.b: "There is little to be gained on insisting."
 patriarch_events.2.title: "Liturgical Influence"
 patriarch_events.2.desc: "The bishop of [local_see_province.GetProvince.GetName] has objected to [target_character.GetName] and the aggrandizing way [target_character.GetSheHe] conducted the consecration of a Cathedral in [local_see_province.GetName]. While he insists he is not ungrateful for the great donations we have given to the Church, the bishop is questioning the use of breaking the liturgical canon to further the interests of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
 patriarch_events.2.a: "He must learn his place!"
 patriarch_events.2.b: "We will make a further donation to the Church to show our humility."
 patriarch_events.3.title: "A [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('cathedral')] for [local_see_province.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 patriarch_events.3.desc: "The [ShowBuildingTypeName('cathedral')] of [local_see_province.GetName] has been damaged and is in urgent need of repair. The Metropolitan has let it be known that he expects us to help fund the repairs and that a general redecoration would also be quite beneficial for the Church.\n\nPious architecture has seen great development since this house of worship was first built and it could certainly benefit from us bringing in foreign experts..."
 patriarch_events.3.a: "Let us give it a worthy renovation!"
 patriarch_events.3.b: "We can repair the damages but no more."
 patriarch_events.4.title: "Heresy in [judaizers_province.GetProvince.GetNameWithNoTooltip]!"
 patriarch_events.4.desc: "Our newly appointed Metropolitan of [judaizers_province.GetProvince.GetName] has uncovered a horrifying local heresy. He claims that the sect is denouncing the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, and the ecclesiastical hierarchy. The Metropolitan has asked us to help him in this time of need as he will require many more resources to root out this heresy which is widespread among high as well as low.\n\nThe case seems very clear. Except it seems the sect has some supporters even in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. Can we really afford to lose the support of these men and women and are they really as heretic as the Metropolitan claims?"
 patriarch_events.4.a: "Heretics must burn!"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_rooting_out_heresy: "Supporting Local Inquisition"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_rooting_out_heresy: "This location is undergoing an inquisition led by its Metropolitan in order to ensure religious conformance and the rooting out of all heresy."
 patriarch_events.4.b: "Clearly he is mistaken."
 patriarch_events.5.title: "Monasteries Flourish in [monastic_province.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 patriarch_events.5.desc: "The Bishop of [monastic_province.GetProvince.GetName] reports that the local monastic communities are growing at an unprecedented speed. The estates of a local monastery in [monastic_province.GetName] have in fact grown so big and are so well-kept that they have become the envy of our local administrator. The governor has become entangled in a conflict with the monks over where exactly the demarcation between their lands and those of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] goes.\n\nThe time has come for central authorities to step in and settle the dispute. Helping the monastery would undoubtedly secure their gratitude, but this could also be an opportunity to get hold of more land for the state..."
 patriarch_events.5.a: "Clearly our governor is right!"
 patriarch_events.5.b: "We must listen to these men of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName]."
