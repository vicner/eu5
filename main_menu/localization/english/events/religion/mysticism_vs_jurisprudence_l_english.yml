 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.1.title: "Spread of Extreme Practices in [spread_of_extreme_practices_province.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.1.desc: "Several new forms of [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('muslim')] mysticism are emerging, one of the most controversial being a brand of Sufi dervishes known as the 'renunciationists'. These men seek to separate themselves entirely from normal society, shaving all body hair down to their eyebrows and publicly breaking the rules of the $sharia$ in order to demonstrate their unique relationship with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName], all while wandering from town to town begging for alms. Our religious scholars are calling for their persecution, arguing that the uneducated populace's tendency to view them with awe will lead the people away from the true faith."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.1.a: "Expel them from [spread_of_extreme_practices_province.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.1.b: "$common_string_leave_them_be$"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.2.title: "Returning Scholars"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.2.desc: "Particularly in the aftermath of the [GetCountry('MGE').GetAdjective] conquests of the thirteenth century, [ShowRegionName('egypt_region')] and Syria emerged as the foremost centers of scholarly learning in the [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('muslim')] world. [ShowReligionAdjective('sunni')] scholars of every persuasion flocked to [ShowLocationName('cairo')] and [ShowLocationName('damascus')] to learn from the most renowned teachers of science, theology, and above all, law; meanwhile, [ShowReligionAdjective('shia')] scholars traveled to [ShowLocationName('sidon')] in [ShowProvinceDefinitionName('lebanon_province')] to meet with the scholars of orthodox Twelver [ShowReligionNameWithNoTooltip('shia')]. Many students from our lands, having completed their educational pilgrimage, are now returning home hoping to implement legalistic [ShowReligionGroupNameWithNoTooltip('muslim')] in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] just as they learned it in the heartlands of [ShowReligionGroupNameWithNoTooltip('muslim')]."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.2.a: "They will make a welcome addition to our country."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.2.b: "Contact with the divine is about more than studying books."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.3.title: "Sufi Organizations Rally Support"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.3.desc: "Popular forms of Sufi worship are becoming extremely widespread across the [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('muslim')] world. Seeing the weakened state of our armies, the $rank_county_arabic_ruler_male$ of major Sufi orders have begun urging their followers to take up arms in support of us against our enemies."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.3.a: "We cannot rely on mystics for support!"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.3.b: "Let us welcome these warriors of faith."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.4.title: "Religious Harmony"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.4.desc: "Just as many members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] have developed Sufi leanings, many of our Sufi orders have likewise come to extol the virtue of a pious life lived in accordance with the $sharia$. Despite disapproving voices on both extremes, we have managed to strike a balance between [ShowSocietyDirectionName('mysticism')] and [ShowSocietyDirectionName('jurisprudence')]. Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] is currently enjoying the fruits of moderation and tolerance of differing religious practices."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.4.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] is good."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.5.title: "Debate over the Philosophy of Ibn 'Arabī"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.5.desc: "Ibn 'Arabī was a 12th century [ShowCultureName('andalusi')] scholar and mystic, regarded by many Sufis as the foremost spiritual master. His pantheistic philosophy of the 'unity of being' viewed all of creation as a manifestation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] and invited worshippers to see divine beauty, not merely in the traditional rituals of [ShowReligionGroupName('muslim')], but in all aspects of life.\n\nEver since, debates have raged on over the compatibility of his philosophy with scholarly interpretations of [ShowReligionGroupNameWithNoTooltip('muslim')], with some going so far as to label him an unbeliever. For many Sufis, on the other hand, Ibn 'Arabī's philosophy became the foundational principle of their religious practice. Now we too are being asked to take sides."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.5.a: "Deny the unity of being."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.5.b: "Support the unity of being."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.6.title: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('dhimmi_estate')] Building Restrictions"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.6.desc: "Under [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('muslim')] Law, non-[ShowReligionGroupAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('muslim')] inhabitants face a number of restrictions on the construction of new buildings in urban centers; their houses are not to be taller than those of the [ShowReligionGroupAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('muslim')] community, and they are forbidden from constructing new centers of worship, only to maintain those which already existed. In practice, these rules often go unenforced, but as our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] shifts further toward a legalistic interpretation of [ShowReligionGroupNameWithNoTooltip('muslim')], key members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] are beginning to call for their stricter implementation."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.6.a: "Enforce the letter of the law."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.6.b: "Leave them to do as they please."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.7.title: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('dhimmi_estate')] Flout Building Restrictions"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.7.desc: "Despite being officially prohibited from constructing houses of worship and tall buildings, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('dhimmi_estate')] in several provinces of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] are openly disobeying the laws, and many of our Qāḍi are too lax to respond, either because they see no harm in it or because of the hefty bribes they can earn for turning a blind eye."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.7.a: "Increase enforcement efforts."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.7.b: "Let these laws go unenforced."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.8.title: "Enjoining Right and Forbidding Wrong"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.8.desc: "[ShowReligionGroupAdjective('muslim')] faithful are encouraged in the $common_string_quran$ to take an active role in their community in order to 'enjoin right and forbid wrong.' While this command has been interpreted in many ways by [ShowReligionGroupAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('muslim')] scholars, reformist groups sometimes used it to justify the forceful spread of more extreme views. A group of charismatic mosque preachers in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] have begun calling for the end of unorthodox religious practices and are inciting the populace against the Sufis, leading to violence and street battles."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.8.a: "Stamp down on the movement."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.8.b: "Offer them our support."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.9.title: "Debate over Sufi Practices"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.9.desc: "[ShowReligionGroupAdjective('muslim')] scholars are of many minds on the question of the permissibility of Sufism. While most appreciate the heightened levels of religious devotion that it inspires among the general population, some disapprove of how certain Sufis express their faith. Poetry and song about wine and illicit love, as well as communal dancing and veneration for the tombs of those regarded as saints, can at times provoke opposition from more hardline elements of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')]."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.9.a: "Support the hardliners."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.9.b: "Support the moderates."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.10.title: "Purification of Tax Laws"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.10.desc: "Ensuring that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]'s laws operate in accordance with the sacred $sharia$ requires us to occasionally re-examine our tax collection practices and to strive to align them as closely as possible with the legal positions held by the great lawmakers of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligiousSchool.GetName] school. This means eliminating the customary taxes which have accumulated over the years and taking only what is permitted by the $sharia$."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.10.a: "The peasantry must be free from unlawful exactions."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.10.b: "Reject the proposal."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.11.title: "Mystics and Storytellers"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.11.desc: "Many among the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] would question the great influence that storytellers have over the life of common men. The traditional hero stories of our people are centuries-old, but they risk making a cult out of seriously distorted fates of historical figures. Prominent clerics in [storytellerprovince.GetName] have taken a strong stand against the storytellers of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] and caution that religious scholars of the past have warned that obsessive listening to stories could lead to false worship."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.11.a: "We must ban offensive stories from the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.11.b: "There is nothing wrong in idealizing our ancestors."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.12.title: "Trade Guilds and Fraternities"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.12.desc: "Guilds and fraternities are a constant factor in the public life of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. In many ways, these are small communities within the larger community, with their own rules, customs, and even laws. It is also very common for these associations to indulge in mystic traditions, Sufism, and often unorthodox adaption of the $sharia$, sometimes making it hard for the laws of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] to penetrate the urban milieu.\n\nArtisans in [fraternity_province.GetName] have reached out to the state, warning us of local guildsmen with great influence on local affairs. Anyone wishing to take up a craft in the city is currently required to be approved by these guilds and then swear oaths of allegiance."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.12.a: "This is unacceptable."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.12.b: "Let us not interfere with the guilds."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.13.title: "Social Dissent and Popular Sufism"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.13.desc: "The great stress that our government has placed on [ShowSocietyDirectionName('jurisprudence')] and the restriction of [ShowSocietyDirectionName('mysticism')] in our society has had the effect of closely associating Sufism with resistance to central rule. In times of social distress, many now look to the Mystical orders for spiritual guidance as an alternative to the highly Legalistic [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] and its [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] ally.\n\nAs tensions flare in [popular_sufism_province.GetProvince.GetName], [master_char.GetName], a resident Sufi Master with great influence, has been voicing his support for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], potentially calming the situation."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.13.a: "There is no need to court a mob of Mystics."
 social_unrest_mysticism: "Social Unrest"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.13.b: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] is good."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.14.title: "[ShowGoodsNameWithNoTooltip('coffee')] and [ShowGoodsNameWithNoTooltip('tobacco')]"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.14.desc: "While they are quite new to our society, the use of stimulants such as [ShowGoodsName('coffee')] and [ShowGoodsName('tobacco')] has spread quickly, with coffee houses now a common feature from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] to [coffee_province.GetName]. The popularity is especially marked among the Sufi orders. The novelty of these substances means that the religious establishment is divided on their proper use.\n\nMany strict legalists want us to limit their use while others argue for caution, as both [ShowGoodsNameWithNoTooltip('coffee')] and [ShowGoodsNameWithNoTooltip('tobacco')] are very popular in our state. Local authorities in [coffee_province.GetNameWithNoTooltip] have now turned to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetNameWithNoTooltip] wanting to close down the local coffee houses that they believe have become meeting places for dissidents."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.14.a: "Let us impose restrictions."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.14.b: "Let them have their [ShowGoodsNameWithNoTooltip('coffee') |l]."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.15.title: "Sufi Orders Growing in Popularity in [new_province.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.15.desc: "Some of the more prevalent Sufi orders in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have quickly started to establish themselves in the newly acquired [new_province.GetName]. While the locals seem somewhat hesitant about [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] rule, they have embraced the orders and this has greatly eased the integration of the [new_province.GetRank.GetName] into our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.15.a: "Strengthen the legal establishment instead."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.15.b: "This is excellent."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.16.title: "Disregard of the $sharia$?"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.16.desc: "The learned [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] complain over the widespread flouting of $sharia$ rules in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. They demand that we reduce the influence of Mystic orders and heterodoxy in the country. Failing to comply could see us losing their support, and many of these valuable legal scholars might even leave for other courts."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.16.a: "Let us follow their recommendations."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.16.b: "We cannot give in to such threats."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.17.title: "Building Restrictions Lapse"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.17.desc: "As our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] loses its zeal for legalistic [ShowReligionGroupName('muslim')], it has become harder and harder for us to find and appoint Qāḍi willing to fully implement our official restrictions on the construction of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('dhimmi_estate')] buildings. The law has, at this point, simply become unenforceable."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.17.a: "Just as well."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.20.title: "A New Ruler"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.20.desc: "Our nation has sorely lacked a firm guiding hand under the rule of [target_heir.GetName], a timid child, ill-prepared to face the dangers of the world. Fortunately for us all, one of [target_heir.GetHerHis] closest advisors has decided to act. The child is now safely taken care of and can do no more harm. The advisor has been proclaimed our new ruler and has sworn to provide our nation with the strong leadership it so desperately needs."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.20.a: "May our new liege's rule be long and prosperous!"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.21.title: "Convert [ShowWorkOfArtNameWithNoTooltip('hagia_sophia')] into a Mosque"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.21.desc: "[GetCountry('BYZ').GetAdjective] Emperor Justinian I built [ShowWorkOfArtName('hagia_sophia')] in 532, choosing Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles to be its architects. The church was built with Hellenistic columns from the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, porphyry stone from [ShowRegionName('egypt_region')], green marble from [ShowProvinceDefinitionName('thessaly_province')], black stone from the [ShowLocationName('bosphorus')], and yellow stone from Syria. That a [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('christian')] church is still in use does not please the people, who wish it to be transformed into a mosque. It is also in dire need of renovation and should be repaired before it is made into a mosque."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.21.a: "Repair it and transform it!"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.21.b: "Leave it be"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.22.title: "Friday Prayers?"
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.22.desc: "The weekly congregational prayer has been a way for [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('muslim')] rulers to show their legitimacy for centuries. In the long-standing [ShowReligionAdjective('sunni')] dominance, most Friday prayers have been in the name of the [ShowReligionAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('sunni')] $rank_empire_muslim_ruler_male$ or $rank_kingdom_muslim_ruler_male$ of the time. This has however led to the status of such prayers being very uncertain in our [ShowReligionAdjective('shia')] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank].\n\nMost among the [ShowReligionAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('shia')] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] oppose the practice of the directed Friday prayers, seeing it as just something that [ShowReligionAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('sunni')] rulers do, but there are some who would see its role as a way to bind together society, both [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.22.a: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will lead the Friday prayers and our country will pray."
 mysticism_vs_jurisprudence.22.b: "Let the people pray however they want."
