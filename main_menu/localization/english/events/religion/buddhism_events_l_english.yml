 buddhism_events.1.desc: "[target_minister.GetName] has publicly condemned the policies of [target_ruler.GetName] and [target_ruler.GetHerHis] government. [target_minister.GetSheHe|U] reminds us that a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] that cannot uphold the rightful laws will attract nothing but liars and informers to [target_ruler.GetHerHis] government, and [target_minister.GetSheHe] does not want to have anything to do with us unless we change our currently wrecked ways."

 buddhism_events.2.desc: "As it is the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s duty to protect the monastic institutions, those institutions also ought to protect the country against bad rulers. Due to what they feel is lacking attentiveness to the duties of a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], and inability and disinterest in upholding and protecting the common good in general, and the monastic organizations of our country in particular, some of the more powerful monasteries have openly come out in condemnation of [target_character.GetName], turning popular opinion against [target_character.GetHerHim]."

 buddhism_events.3.title: "Precedent of [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 buddhism_events.3.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName] has always been sensible and proper with [target_ruler.GetHerHis] decisions. So much so, that in a recently created addendum to a collection of the laws of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], one of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHisHerFormal|U] recent rulings was considered so just and well-argued that it has been used as an example to strive for in similar cases. As [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] has become known for [target_ruler.GetHerHis] stringent and constant to adhere to the virtues of the Dasavidha-rājadhamma, the tenfold virtue of the ruler according to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetName], this is not the first time [target_ruler.GetHerHis] rule has been put forward as a good example."

 buddhism_events.4.title: "The Horrors of War"
 buddhism_events.4.desc: "Not all men are cut out to lead a life of war, and it seems the conflict our country is currently in has made some of them realize it. The number of deserters seeking to hide behind the walls of the monasteries is not big but they set a dangerous example. As a pious [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], however, it is our duty to protect the monasteries, and while we have repeatedly warned them not to accept men like these it seems some still do."

 buddhism_events.4.b: "Demand that the monasteries release these 'monks' to us."

 buddhism_events.5.title: "Bountiful Harvest"
 buddhism_events.5.desc: "This harvest has been unusually bountiful and we could well make use of this unexpected wealth to fund planned religious works. An extra tax has been suggested to transfer the extra grain from the farmers to the state. However, traditional [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] teachings dictate that we cannot act in a way that oppresses the populace, and some of our ministers seem uneasy with burdening them with an extra tax."
 buddhism_events.5.a: "Levy the tax."
 buddhism_events.5.b: "Let us not steal the fruits of their labor."

 buddhism_events.6.title: "Dāna"
 buddhism_events.6.desc: "It is at times such as these, when our country is characterized by relative tranquility, that we are reminded to look at those who are less fortunate. The recent crop yields have been neither failures nor great successes and as a result, most have food and the state has ample grain supplies. There are, however, still some unfortunate souls who have not got enough food to feed themselves. Is it in times like these where we have to keep in mind the most the Dāna, the act of charity and giving of alms according to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] teachings."

 buddhism_events.7.title: "Pariccāga"
 buddhism_events.7.desc: "As our country finds itself at war and our troops are immersed in battle, our people turn towards our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] for leadership and guidance. Many voices are of the opinion that one of the key virtues of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetName], that is Pariccāga, self-sacrifice, will be best expressed by [target_ruler.GetName] sharing our warriors's fate and joining them in battle, even at the cost of [target_ruler.GetHerHis] own safety.\n\nOthers, however, argue that Pariccāga is not the complete disregard of one's own self, but the restrain in prioritizing only one's own interests, and that ensuring the safety of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] not only does not go against [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] teachings, but is paramount to ensure the safety of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
 buddhism_events.7.a: "[target_ruler.GetSheHe|U] should lead by example."
 buddhism_events.7.b: "This is not what self-sacrifice is actually about."

 buddhism_events.8.title: "Tapa"
 buddhism_events.8.desc: "Recently, [target_ruler.GetName] has come under attack by those who feel [target_ruler.GetHerHis] rule has been one of extravagance and conspicuous consumption. Some among our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle], however, insist that a certain amount of luxury is necessary for a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], especially when dealing with foreign rulers and their emissaries."

 buddhism_events.8.b: "We cannot stoop to the level of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('peasants_estate')]..."

 buddhism_events.9.title: "Inheritance"
 buddhism_events.9.desc: "A conflict has arisen in one [ShowBuildingTypeName('monastery')] of the more influential ones of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] after the death of a monk who came from a very influential lay family. The matter for debate is who should inherit the rich set of valuable manuscripts and an assortment of Buddha images, among other things, that were in the room of the deceased. While monks cannot own property as such, the law still allows for a dedicated disciple to inherit these things and be considered as a son of the monk. In this case, the [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('monastery')] mentions a young disciple who took care of the monk until the final day.\n\nThere are, however, others interested, and the [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('monastery')] itself has argued that they should get the inheritance and would likely be very thankful for support in this matter. The lay family of the monk has also approached our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle], hoping to inherit not only the manuscripts and images but also some of the land that had been donated to the [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('monastery')] while their family member was part of it."
 buddhism_events.9.a: "Rule in favor of the disciple."
 buddhism_events.9.b: "Rule in favor of the [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('monastery')]."
 buddhism_events.9.c: "Support the lay family of the monk."

 buddhism_events.10.title: "Foreign Emissary Insults [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 buddhism_events.10.desc: "The recent embassy from the [target_country.GetLongName] has taken a bad turn when the emissary has given a grave affront to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] by refusing to participate in a ceremony that had been organized for such an occasion. [target_ruler.GetName] is furious, and while there can be some doubt as to whether the slight was deliberate or not, the public clearly sees it as such.\n\nIf we do not publicly condemn the ambassador we risk losing face, but many among our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle], however, urge caution."
 buddhism_events.10.a: "Publicly deride the ambassador."
 buddhism_events.10.b: "A [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] must never lose [target_ruler.GetHerHis] temper."

 buddhism_events.11.title: "The Laws of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 buddhism_events.11.desc: "[ShowReligionGroupAdjective('buddhist')] law is generally practiced in one form or another in many [ShowReligionGroupAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('buddhist')] countries. While these laws are not collected and written down by the states themselves, they do vary from country to country and at times a collection will have to be updated or renewed. Recently, such a collection has taken place in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and it has produced an updated version of one of the most commonly used law collections in our country.\n\nAs the collection itself builds upon actual cases, it can, however, be seen as quite an up-to-date commentary on the rulings of [target_ruler.GetName]."
 buddhism_events.11.a: "Excellent! Promote these laws."
 buddhism_events.11.a.tt1: "As our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has not been completely fair to [target_ruler.GetHerHis] subjects, this collection of laws reflects badly upon [target_ruler.GetHerHim] and will decrease our [prestige|e]."

 buddhism_events.11.a.tt4: "As our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has been all but fair to [target_ruler.GetHerHis] subjects, this collection of laws reflects greatly negatively upon [target_ruler.GetHerHim] and will damage our [prestige|e]."
 buddhism_events.11.b: "Let us do what we can to stop this from spreading."

 buddhism_events.12.title: "Lawyers at Odds"
 buddhism_events.12.desc: "Lawyers placing bets on the outcome of a legal dispute is nothing uncommon in our lands, and neither is a certain degree of friendly rivalry among the professionals in a courtroom. Once such rivalry turns into actual anger and passion, then the integrity of our laws is at stake.\n\nIt appears that the two sides on a recent court case, one a rich [ShowBuildingTypeName('monastery')] and the other a family of some influence among the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')], have turned a simple legal conflict about a sizable estate into a heated row. This is very unfortunate, and it now falls upon our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] to attempt to salvage the face of both sides in a fair way without compromising the integrity of our legal system."

 buddhism_events.13.title: "A Useful Alliance?"
 buddhism_events.13.desc: "It has been a while already since [GetCharacter('kublai_khan').GetName] adopted the [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('buddhist')] religion and sought to spread it among [GetCharacter('kublai_khan').GetHerHis] people. Over the years, however, many have returned to the old ways of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetName]. [target_ruler.GetName] has always been fascinated by the legacy of the likes of the Great $rank_kingdom_horde_ruler_suffix_male$ and the empires they once created in the name of that religion. As word reached us of a dynamic and growing [ShowCultureGroupName('tibetan_group')] monastic order, it was therefore clear to [target_ruler.GetHerHim] that this needed to be investigated.\n\nThe emissary of the Lama now stands before us and has explained that they interpret that [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] is a reincarnation of [GetCharacter('kublai_khan').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]. The order is also prepared to support our rule if we allow them to spread their sect in all the lands we control."
 buddhism_events.13.a: "The time for change has come."
 buddhism_events.13.b: "Let us stick to our old ways."

 buddhism_events.14.title: "Idol Figures"
 buddhism_events.14.desc: "The conversion of a country to a [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('buddhist')] one does not happen overnight, and a great number of people within our borders still worship in the old ways. Eager to spread their religion, however, many of the foremost Lamas in our country have condemned the common figures that many common people still honor and demanded that they all be destroyed."
 buddhism_events.14.a: "Burn them all!"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_destruction_of_idols: "Destruction of Idols"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_destruction_of_idols: "A campaign to destroy pagan idols in our country is hardly gaining us any friends among the diehard supporters of the old religion but it is greatly speeding up the conversion of all pagans even if one might doubt the sincerity of some."
 buddhism_events.14.b: "Let us give them time..."

 buddhism_events.15.title: "[ShowAreaNameWithNoTooltip('sailan_area')]"
 buddhism_events.15.desc: "The island of [ShowAreaName('sailan_area')], recently conquered by our troops, is full of rich [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('buddhist')] monasteries and society seems to be practically run by the monks within them. As [target_ruler.GetName] has finally gotten to visit them, [target_ruler.GetSheHe] stands in awe before the economic and cultural wealth of the monastic orders."
 buddhism_events.15.a: "We must make this part of our culture!"
 buddhism_events.15.b: "Plunder their monasteries!"
 buddhism_events.15.b.tt: "Every [pop|e] in every owned [location|e] in [ShowAreaName('sailan_area')] loses [ShowNamedValue('pop_satisfaction_severe_penalty')|+=2%] [pop_satisfaction|e]"

 buddhism_events.16.title: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] Monasteries Deteriorating"
 buddhism_events.16.desc: "Due to a combination of lacking monastic discipline and a faltering economy, many of the great monasteries of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have seen their membership dwindling over the last few years. A concerned member of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] has approached the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] with a warning that unless something is done soon, the dire situation may lead to the last few monks abandoning their vows or seeking to join monasteries elsewhere, leaving [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] impoverished both spiritually and economically.\n\nThere are, however, many local landowners more than ready to infringe on the land an empty [ShowBuildingTypeName('monastery')] would leave behind. As the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] is meant to protect monastic life in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip], it will be clear to many observers that the responsibility for whatever happens will rest on [target_ruler.GetHerHis] shoulders."
 buddhism_events.16.a: "We must do all we can!"
 buddhism_events.16.b: "Perhaps now the land will come to better use."

 buddhism_events.17.title: "Monastic Vows Broken"
 buddhism_events.17.desc: "The religious discipline of the monks of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is faltering. As a result of lacking funds, monopolization of higher monastic positions by a small group of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')], and a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] unable to protect the faithful in the way expected of a true [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('buddhist')] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], more and more monks seem to be breaking their vows to abandon monastic life, or in some cases maintaining it while not honoring its principles.\n\nA particularly glaring case of a monk breaking his vows and inciting others do to the same has recently come to our attention, and many will likely read a great deal into the way we choose to deal with this. While a good [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] should always show mercy and gentleness, it is also the duty of any [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] to uphold the discipline of the monasteries, with force if needed."

It is in many ways a model society for a [ShowReligionNameWithNoTooltip('theravada')] state and its thriving monastic communities are the envy of the [ShowReligionGroupAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('buddhist')] world.\n\nWhile our own state also follows the [ShowReligionNameWithNoTooltip('theravada')] way, our laws and traditions are a patchwork of local traditions and ideas from competing [ShowReligionGroupAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('buddhist')] schools, and we lack the strong monastic infrastructure of the island. Some in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] suggest that in order to remedy this, we should send an embassy to [ShowAreaNameWithNoTooltip('sailan_area')] and ask that they send us monks to carry their [ShowReligionNameWithNoTooltip('theravada')] traditions to our country."

 buddhism_events.1301.desc: "Thriving monastic communities, holy sacred relics, as well as a long tradition of how to handle the coexistence of monastic and regal power, make us the envy of many [ShowReligionName('theravada')] rulers. It is therefore no surprise that the [target_origin_country.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] of [target_origin_country.GetName] should aspire to imitate our greatness. The [target_origin_country.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] embassy that arrived today asks that we allow a number of their monks to travel to our country and receive ordination here in order to bring our traditions to [target_origin_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
