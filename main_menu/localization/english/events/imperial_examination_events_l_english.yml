#Historical Info for various bureaucrats

  imperial_examination_events.2.historical_info: "Liú Bówén, a prominent figure during the late Yuán and early Míng dynasties, rose from humble beginnings to become renowned for his exceptional intellect, strategic prowess, and political foresight. He played a crucial role in overthrowing the Mongol-led Yuán dynasty and establishing the Míng dynasty, contributing significantly to military campaigns that led to the Míng's rise to power. Beyond his military achievements, Liú was also renowned for his literary and scholarly contributions to Chinese literature and philosophy, leaving a lasting legacy as a multifaceted figure in Chinese history."
  imperial_examination_events.3.historical_info: "Yú Qiān began his career in the Míng civil service in 1421 after passing the imperial examination as a jìnshì. His loyalty and service led to his appointment as Grand Coordinator of Shānxī and Hénán by the Xuāndé Emperor. Despite facing imprisonment due to conflicts with influential figures, during the reign of the Míng Yīngzōng Emperor, he was reinstated and eventually promoted to Minister of War. Yú Qiān's pivotal role in defending Beijing against Oirat Mongol attacks in 1449 earned him further recognition, but he was later executed for alleged treason during the political turmoil that followed."
  imperial_examination_events.4.historical_info: "After obtaining his jìnshì degree in 1442, Hán Yōng served as a censor before being promoted to provincial inspector for Jiāngxī in 1452. During his tenure, he oversaw the restoration of the Téng Wáng Pavilion. In 1465, he played a key role as a military inspector in Zhào Fū's campaign against a rebellion of Miáo peoples in Dàténg Xiá. Following the successful conclusion of the campaign, Hán Yōng was appointed Viceroy of Liǎngguǎng to continue his efforts in pacifying the region, although he eventually retired due to attacks from his subordinates."
  imperial_examination_events.5.historical_info: "Xú Pǔ, a prominent political figure in the Míng Dynasty, demonstrated remarkable scholarly prowess by achieving the prestigious title of jìnshì in 1454. Serving diligently in various administrative roles, he notably undertook the task of compiling the Collected Statutes of the Míng Dynasty, a significant legal undertaking entrusted to him in 1497. Despite facing challenges in curtailing the influence of certain factions, Xú Pǔ's tenure exemplified a commitment to compromise and benevolent governance. Beyond his political endeavors, Xú Pǔ's legacy endures through his acts of philanthropy, exemplified by his bequeathal of tax-free land to aid the impoverished within his clan, earning him posthumous recognition as Wén Jìng."
  imperial_examination_events.6.historical_info: "Wáng Yángmíng, a multifaceted figure of the Míng Dynasty, emerged as a pivotal Neo-Confucian thinker, challenging Zhū Xī's orthodox philosophy by emphasizing intuitive understanding over rationalist dualism. Rising from a lineage of scholarly distinction, Wáng's military exploits as a general were marked by strict discipline and a compassionate approach to quelling revolts, advocating for amnesty amidst conflict. Central to his philosophical contributions was the concept of innate knowing, positing that individuals possess an inherent understanding of morality from birth. His establishment of the Lu-Wáng school, alongside Lù Jiǔyuān, propelled his influence across China and Japan, where his teachings inspired prominent figures and even influenced the development of bushidō. Wáng Yángmíng's enduring legacy extends beyond his era, shaping Confucian thought and ethical discourse well into modern times, both in China and Japan, where his profound impact continues to reverberate through intellectual and political spheres."
