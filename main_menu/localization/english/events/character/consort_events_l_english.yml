 consort_events.1.title: "An Offer of Marriage"
 consort_events.1.desc: "It is with some consternation that the mighty families of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] have watched [target_ruler.GetName] let the years pass [target_ruler.GetHerHim] by without finding someone to marry. These feelings have now turned into open dismay since, despite the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] lacking a clear line of succession, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] appears to have no plans to find a spouse nor is [target_ruler.GetHeSheFormal] showing much interest in the proposals sent to [target_ruler.GetHerHim].\n\nIt has now reached the point where the court is expecting the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] to accept one of the offers on the table. Continued failure to secure the succession puts the entire country at risk. Luckily, one of the oldest and most prestigious families from [origin_of_queens_family.GetName], the [target_consort.GetDynasty.GetName], has offered us the hand of one of their daughters in marriage, along with a generous dowry."
 consort_events.1.a: "Accept the offer."
 consort_events.1.a.tt: "By accepting this offer it is understood that the family of our new spouse can expect certain favors in the future."
 consort_events.1.b: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] must save [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] for a better offer."

 consort_events.2.title: "The House of [target_consort.GetDynasty.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 consort_events.2.desc: "With the union of [target_ruler.GetName] and [target_consort.GetName], we have gained not only a spouse, but also a new ally in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. The [target_consort.GetDynasty.GetName] are an old and influential family and their seat in [origin_of_queens_family.GetName] is a jewel of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank].\n\nOf course, friendship has to go both ways, and [target_consort.GetName] will be expected to speak for [target_consort.GetHerHis] kin while our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] will be expected to consider such advice very carefully."
 consort_events.2.a: "To everlasting friendship!"

 consort_events.3.title: "Great Expectations"
 consort_events.3.desc: "A political marriage is as much a union of families as it is a contract of mutual support. The [target_consort.GetDynasty.GetName] family expects that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] will heed the advice of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle] and actively look after both their and [target_ruler.GetName]'s interests."
 consort_events.3.a: "Anything for our dear [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle]."
 consort_events.3.b: "Sorry, no special favors."
 consort_events.3.b.tt: "This will result in lessened cooperation from the [target_consort.GetDynasty.GetName] on the local level and they will also hold it against us in the future."

 consort_events.4.title: "Marital Bliss"
 consort_events.4.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle] is of course a constant companion and good advisor in [target_consort.GetHerHis] own right. However, apart from that role, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle] is also a representative of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] to the [target_consort.GetDynasty.GetName] house and vice versa. At times, this is not an arrangement without benefits.\n\nToday, [target_consort.GetName] seems very pleased to announce that [target_consort.GetHerHis] family has decided to show its support to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] and to the union of [target_ruler.GetName] and [target_consort.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 consort_events.4.a: "May this union bring benefits to us both."
 consort_events.4.b: "We must avoid indebting ourselves to the [target_consort.GetDynasty.GetName] family."

 consort_events.6.title: "To Love and Be Loved"
 consort_events.6.desc: "A [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] marriage is rarely a matter of love. Rather, it is a diplomatic opportunity which is not to be wasted. It is also of great importance that the future [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle] is of suitable status and it is advantageous if they are a foreigner, so as not to disturb the balance of internal politics.\n\nHowever, even a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] can become love-struck. When that happens, all such matters seem to melt away - from [target_ruler.GetHerHis] point of view, at least.\n\nA local from the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetProvince.GetName] province has caught [target_ruler.GetName]'s eye. [target_ruler.GetSheHe|U] appears to be entirely and endlessly enamored and happier than ever for it. While our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] and advisors are less than pleased, the union between [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] and [target_ruler.GetHerHis] beloved has strong support among the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] of the realm."
 consort_events.6.a: "Let the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] have [target_ruler.GetHerHis] heart's desire."
 consort_events.6.b: "Marrying a lowborn? Totally out of the question!"

 consort_events.51.title: "Family Ties"
 consort_events.51.desc: "For the past couple of days, we have been entertaining guests from the [origin_country_of_consort.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] court of [origin_country_of_consort.GetName], the once home of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle]. After a full week of hunting, feasting, and gossiping with the family, they are finally preparing to return to [origin_country_of_consort.GetCapital.GetName]. They assure us that they have had a wonderful time and insist that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] family simply must come to visit [origin_country_of_consort.GetCapital.GetNameWithNoTooltip] soon. They will be certain to inform everybody back home about how [target_consort.GetName] is happier here than ever before."
 consort_events.51.a: "This is what it means to be kin."
 we_are_kin: "We Are Kin"

 consort_events.52.title: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective|U] Heretic"
 consort_events.52.desc: "The people of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] were pleased when [target_ruler.GetName] announced [target_ruler.GetHerHis] marriage to [target_consort.GetName]. At the time, little was said about [target_consort.GetHerHis] origin or [target_consort.GetHerHis] upbringing in [origin_country_of_consort.GetCapital.GetName]. To most common folk in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip], the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] family are a breed of their own and they care little for such details. However, rumors bringing these issues to the fore have recently begun to spread... Some say that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle] has refused to let go of [target_consort.GetHerHis] old [origin_country_of_consort.GetReligion.GetAdjective] faith. While the people may understand the need for a marriage with a foreigner, they are less likely to be so amenable when it comes to being ruled by a heretic."
 consort_events.52.a: "How dare they?"

 consort_events.54.title: "The Skills of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle]"
 consort_events.54.desc: "Ever since [target_consort.GetName] arrived at court, [target_consort.GetSheHe] has taken a great interest in the administrative affairs of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. It has reached a point where the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle] has become something of an authority on matters relating to the staff and running the castle and is trusted not only by the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself], but by the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] in general. Rarely has the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] seen such efficiency."
 consort_events.54.a: "[target_consort.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] is a blessing."
 consort_events.54.b: "The world needs more people like [target_consort.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]."
 consort_events.54.c: "We could always use more strategists."
 consort_events.54.d: "What an asset this [target_consort.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] is."

 consort_events.56.title: "Times of Need"
 consort_events.56.desc: "The dynasty of our noble [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], [target_ruler.GetDynasty.GetName], is certainly a powerful one. Through [target_ruler.GetName], they rule our nation and will do so for many years to come, but even the great are sometimes in need of help. Thankfully, the [target_ruler.GetDynasty.GetNameWithNoTooltip] family has tied strong bonds to other great powers, such as the [target_foreign_ruler.GetDynasty.GetName] house of no other than [target_foreign_ruler.GetName] of [marriage_partner.GetName]. [target_foreign_ruler.GetHerHis|U] gracious [target_foreign_consort.GetWifeHusband], [target_foreign_consort.GetName], is a [target_foreign_consort.GetDaughterSon] of our own [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] house and an invaluable contact. Perhaps we shall ask [target_foreign_consort.GetHimHerFormal] if [target_foreign_consort.GetSheHe] can influence [target_foreign_consort.GetHerHis] [target_foreign_ruler.GetWifeHusband] to lend us a hand?"
 consort_events.56.a: "Our coffers are getting worryingly light."
 consort_events.56.a.tt: "Send a letter to [target_foreign_consort.GetName] of [marriage_partner.GetName], asking [target_foreign_consort.GetHerHim] for money"
 consort_events.56.f: "We do not need any help from [marriage_partner.GetNameWithNoTooltip] or house [target_foreign_ruler.GetDynasty.GetNameWithNoTooltip]!"

 consort_events.57.title: "Friends in Need"
 consort_events.57.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle] of our illustrious [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], [target_foreign_consort.GetName], recently brought us a request from [target_foreign_consort.GetHerHis] family, house [target_foreign_consort.GetDynasty.GetName] of [target_origin_country.GetName]. Apparently, [target_ruler.GetName] is in dire need of money and has asked us, '[target_ruler.GetHerHis] most trusted friends', if we can contribute in any way. [target_ruler.GetHerHis|U] letter is filled with compliments for our great economy."
 consort_events.57.a: "We can surely spare some coin for our [target_origin_country.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] friends."
 grateful_for_aid: "Grateful for Aid"
 consort_events.57.f: "And what would we get in return? No, never!"

 consort_events.58.title: "A Helping Hand"
 consort_events.58.desc: "Finally, we have heard back from dearest [target_foreign_consort.GetName] regarding our request for [target_foreign_consort.GetHerHis] [target_foreign_ruler.GetWifeHusband]. The most noble [target_foreign_ruler.GetName] has decided to grant it! The reply came with coffers full of gold to fill our emptying treasury. A letter of thanks shall be sent immediately to the generous [marriage_partner.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]. Long may [target_foreign_ruler.GetSheHe] reign!"
 consort_events.58.a: "We always knew we had a friend in [target_foreign_ruler.GetHerHim]."

 consort_events.59.title: "Broken Promises"
 consort_events.59.desc: "When we married our [target_foreign_consort.GetName] to the [marriage_partner.GetAdjective] [marriage_partner.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], we thought a strong bond had been formed between our countries. While we would never dishonor our part in this deal, apparently [target_foreign_ruler.GetName] holds no such qualms.\n\n[target_foreign_consort.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]'s letter of response reached us today. Not only did [target_foreign_ruler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] refuse our request, [target_foreign_ruler.GetHeSheFormal] also had the nerve to reproach us for our 'outrageous demands!'"
 consort_events.59.a: "This offense will not be forgotten."

 consort_events.61.title: "A [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective|U] Influence"
 consort_events.61.desc: "With the marriage between [target_ruler.GetName] and [target_ruler.GetHerHis] [target_consort.GetWifeHusband] [target_consort.GetName], the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are experiencing an increased fondness for all things [origin_country_of_consort.GetAdjective]. While some cultural exchange was to be expected, particularly considering the popularity of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle], it is with alarm that our advisors report that a religious shift has been taking place in one of our provinces. It would seem that the influence of our [origin_country_of_consort.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle] trickles down even into our subjects' way of worship, as the words of the [origin_country_of_consort.GetReligion.GetAdjective] believers have converted a surprising amount of our people...\n\nWhen confronted about it, [target_consort.GetNameWithNoTooltip] shrugged, arguing that [target_consort.GetSheHe] has long since accepted the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] faith and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] should know that."
 consort_events.61.a: "[target_consort.GetSheHe|U] must publicly denounce [origin_country_of_consort.GetReligion.GetNameWithNoTooltip]!"
 consort_events.61.b: "So be it."

 consort_events.101.title: "The Ambitions of a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle]"
 consort_events.101.desc: "It is no news that [target_consort.GetName] has no fond feelings for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeir.GetName]. Ever since [target_consort.GetHeSheFormal] arrived at court, the friction between the two has been obvious and it has only gotten worse since the birth of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle]'s first child. Of course, [target_consort.GetSheHe] would much rather see [target_consort.GetHerHis] own progeny on the throne. For quite some time now, [target_consort.GetSheHe] has silently been pulling strings to make that happen, convincing - or bribing - the right people and grooming [target_consort.GetHerHis] child to the best of [target_consort.GetHerHis] abilities. However, it was not until yesterday that [target_consort.GetSheHe] confronted our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] and demanded that it was time for a new [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle] to be appointed."
 consort_events.101.a: "[target_consort.GetName]'s child is a legitimate choice, there is no doubt about it."
 consort_events.101.b: "How dare [target_consort.GetSheHe] question [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeir.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s claim to the throne?"

 consort_events.102.title: "Playing Favorites"
 consort_events.102.desc: "They say that a parent's love for their child is without limits, but it is obvious that some loves are greater than others. While [target_ruler.GetName] is certainly fond of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeir.GetName], everyone knows that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeir.GetHerHis] [favorite_child.GetSisterBrother] holds a greater place in [target_ruler.GetName]'s heart. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] dotes on [favorite_child.GetHerHim] and has made sure that [favorite_child.GetSheHe] has had the very best education. Now [target_consort.GetName] is trying to convince the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] to make [favorite_child.GetName] the new [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 consort_events.102.a: "It is not a bad idea. [favorite_child.GetNameWithNoTooltip] is exceptionally clever."

 consort_events.104.title: "Like [target_consort.GetMotherFather|U], like [target_heir.GetDaughterSon|U]"
 consort_events.104.desc: "Over the years, our noble [target_consort.GetName] has impressed us time and time again with [target_consort.GetHerHis] excellent knowledge and skills. [target_consort.GetSheHe] is clearly an educated [target_consort.GetWomanMan] and [target_consort.GetHerHis] interest in learning has sown a seed in [target_consort.GetHerHis] [target_heir.GetDaughterSon], [target_heir.GetName]. The apple does not fall far from the tree, indeed."
 consort_events.104.a: "[target_consort.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] will instruct [target_heir.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] on every aspect of our nation's administration."
 consort_events.104.b: "[target_consort.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] shall teach [target_heir.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] the finer points of politics."

 consort_events.303.title: "The Diplomatic Approach of [target_consort.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 consort_events.303.desc: "While growing up in [origin_of_consort.GetName], [target_consort.GetName] enjoyed studying people. [target_consort.GetHeSheFormal|U] often made a game out of trying to predict the actions of the people around [target_consort.GetHerHim], finding it to be not only fun, but an increasingly useful habit to keep  as the years went by. Thankfully, moving to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] court of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has not caused [target_consort.GetHerHim] to abandon [target_consort.GetHerHis] knack for intrigue. If anything [target_consort.GetSheHe] has gotten a lot of practice - during some of our recent negotiations with foreign diplomats, these skills have proven most valuable to the council."

 consort_events.304.title: "The Administrative Ideas of [target_consort.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 consort_events.304.desc: "Combined with a strong moral compass, [target_consort.GetName] has always had a sense of order. Decisions made by [target_consort.GetHerHim] are trustworthy, be they advice about political issues or suggestions during a friendly conversation. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle] speaks [target_consort.GetHerHis] mind eloquently, something that awarded [target_consort.GetHerHim] some admiration even during [target_consort.GetHerHis] early days in [origin_of_consort.GetName]. Most importantly, however, the words of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle] carry honesty with them, making even the most stubborn members of the court heed any advice [target_consort.GetSheHe] offers."

 consort_events.305.title: "The Military Ideas of [target_consort.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 consort_events.305.desc: "[target_consort.GetName|U] is proving to be a fearless [target_consort.GetWomanMan]. Often seen studying the technique of the soldiers during their training, sometimes [target_consort.GetHeSheFormal] even approaches the practice grounds [target_consort.GetHerselfHimself]. While some were initially hesitant to engage the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle] in melee, others were curious regarding the skills that [target_consort.GetSheHe] might have brought with [target_consort.GetHerHim] from [target_consort.GetHerHis] life in [origin_of_consort.GetName]. Even though it was a surprise to some people, [target_consort.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s reputation for being able to handle [target_consort.GetHerselfHimself] in a fight is not an unwarranted one. In addition, the presence of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle] seems to have an encouraging effect on the troops."
 consort_events.305.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('common_string_positive')]"

 consort_events.306.title: "A Shared Interest"
 consort_events.306.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName|U] is known for possessing a mind for organization. Making sure that both the people as well as the administration of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] adhere to the law, while also updating and adjusting the system to fit the times we live in, is of great interest to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]. Imagine [target_ruler.GetHerHis] joy upon realizing that [target_ruler.GetHerHis] [target_consort.GetWifeHusband] shares many of these interests!\n\nFor [target_ruler.GetHerHim], a conversation with [target_consort.GetName] is as stimulating as any council meeting. [target_consort.GetSheHe|U] responds to such discussions with a smile, likewise enjoying bonding with [target_consort.GetHerHis] [target_ruler.GetWifeHusband] over these matters."

 consort_events.309.title: "The Success of the Succession"
 consort_events.309.desc: "Since the death of [target_char.GetHerHis] spouse, [target_char.GetName] has been growing increasingly comfortable in [target_char.GetHerHis] position, as both guardian of the young [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle] as well as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetActiveRegentTitle] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. To the general public, it is clear that the situation is temporary and simply a political necessity while everyone awaits the ascension of little [target_char_heir.GetName]. However, there are rumors of other characters who are said to partake in clandestine meetings where they discuss the potential of the young [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle], or lack thereof. They argue that letting [target_char_heir.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] rule would be akin to putting a drooling imbecile in charge and a threat to the entire country, while the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle] is certainly a much better option in their eyes.\n\nAlthough certainly aware of these cunning forces, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle] [target_char.GetHerselfHimself] has yet to take a stand on this highly sensitive issue."
 consort_events.309.a: "These are interesting times..."
 consort_events.309.a.tt: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle] will discuss these ideas with [target_char.GetHerHis] closest council"

 consort_events.309.b.tt: "The instigators will not be encouraged."

 consort_events.310.title: "A Shift in Power"
 consort_events.310.desc: "Utilizing advice from [target_char.GetHerHis] closest advisors while putting [target_char.GetHerHis] charm to the test, [target_char.GetName] has cleverly manipulated a good amount of members of the court into agreement: [target_heir.GetName], the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle] and next in line to rule is a feeble-minded fool, unworthy of [target_heir.GetHerHis] legacy. However, there is a simple solution to the problem...\n\nDuring yet another extravagant feast thrown in order to appeal to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] in charge, [target_char.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] and [target_char.GetHerHis] lackeys have managed to popularize the idea of keeping the young [target_heir.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] locked away in [target_heir.GetHerHis] quarters. Some isolation would allow the child to focus on [target_heir.GetHerHis] education, it is argued. That the young [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle] might also fade from the public eye is unfortunate for [target_heir.GetHerHim], but ultimately a bonus for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

During a recent trip to [poor_province.GetName], [target_char.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] saw the suffering of its poorest [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] with [target_char.GetHerHis] own eyes. Ever since, [target_char.GetSheHe] has been drafting a plan to aid [target_char.GetHerHis] most destitute subjects.
