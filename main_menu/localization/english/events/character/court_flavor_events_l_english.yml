However, it would seem that [advisor.GetSheHe] has not cut all ties to [advisor.GetHerHis] countrymen in [advisor_liaisons_target_country.GetLongName]. [advisor.GetSheHe|U] has been pushing for better relations with [advisor.GetHerHis] homeland, [advisor_liaisons_target_country.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip], and has offered to leverage [advisor.GetHerHis] contacts in the [advisor_liaisons_target_country.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] court to push the [advisor_liaisons_target_country.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] to adopt a more friendly position towards us."

Indeed, the response they received was openly hostile. Not only were they unambiguously told that [advisor_liaisons_target_country.GetLongName] is not interested in better relations with [advisor_liaisons_target_country.GetLongName], but [advisor.GetName] has been given to understand that [advisor.GetSheHe] is henceforth not welcome in [advisor_liaisons_target_country.GetLongName].

 court_flavor_events.20.desc: "[advisor.GetName]'s spending habits have raised some eyebrows. [advisor.GetSheHe|U] has been spending large amounts of money - far larger than one in [advisor.GetHerHis] position should have access to - distributing gifts to the local [advisor.GetEstateType.GetName] in [advisor.GetHerHis] home region and improving the local infrastructure. An investigation has revealed the facts: Rather than serving the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] to the best of [advisor.GetHerHis] abilities, [advisor.GetNameWithNoTooltip] has been funneling state funds to [corrupt_advisor_location.GetName] in order to boost [advisor.GetHerHis] popularity there.
