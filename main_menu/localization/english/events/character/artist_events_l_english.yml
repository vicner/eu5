 artist_events.1.desc: "Known for [target_character.GetHerHis] story-telling skills, [target_character.GetName] has recently forayed into liturgical and theological works, intertwining the divine with comedy and satire. These works, while caustic to the station of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] in our society, have brought forth a wave of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] with an interest in culture and the written arts. Pressure has been mounting, motivated by our affected [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')], to rid our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] of [target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip] lest we risk the ire of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName]."

Indeed, [target_character.GetHerHis] skills to insult through entertainment are unparalleled to none. [target_character.GetHerHis|U] latest works were meant to be an ode to our great people, only to end up being a scathing retort, listing our shortcomings and greatest failures!"
 artist_events.2.a: "What an absolute fool!"
 artist_events.2.b: "Let us fund [target_character.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]'s improvement efforts!"

In exchange, we would have to part ways with a modest sum for [target_character.GetHerHis] services. It is said that [target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s skills are versatile and the result will likely please even our most cultured and artistic individuals."

Few have reached such prominence to the level of [target_character.GetName], whose skills with the pen are fabled and move our people by the thousands.

 artist_events.6.title: "The Wall Art of [target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 artist_events.6.desc: "The many colors involved in the creation of art are but second nature to many painters such as [target_character.GetName]. [target_character.GetHerHis|U] strokes bring joy to the people, bringing together poor and rich, healthy and infirm, as they marvel at the sight of artwork imprinted around the center of [target_location.GetName]. Recently, we have been receiving a mounting number of requests to further fund this new art style by erecting more walls for [target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip] to beautify."

 artist_events.7.title: "A Joke Too Much"
 artist_events.7.desc: "It is said that humor is a frequent guest within our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle], with jesters and comedians filling our dignitaries full of laughter on joyous occasions.

This indecent display will surely chip away at our prestige unless the perpetrator is punished."

 artist_events.8.title: "Immortalizing the Visage"

 artist_events.8.a: "Immortalized in the books of history does have a nice ring to it."
 artist_events.8.b: "Better yet, give it to the people!"
 artist_events.8.c: "The coin is ours and ours alone!"

 artist_events.9.title: "The Accidental Insult"
 artist_events.9.desc: "In a feeble attempt to impress prominent figures of our society, [target_character.GetName] spearheaded an effort to paint an elaborate scene featuring leaders of the various estates. However, due to [target_character.GetHerHis] incompetence, the painting was perceived as a hit piece aimed at poking fun at the physical appearance of many powerful men, resulting in a comical loss of prestige on our end."

 artist_events.11.title: "Mind Your Head!"
 artist_events.11.desc: "It is a fact that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] is a bustling center full of life and commotion. Regular folk constantly toiling the fields, riding around the many markets, or idly chatting about. However, our recent foray into funding our local sculptors has given way to a growing number of accidents. Indeed, many of our people report incidents of falling debris and pieces of marble, as sculptors maniacally work around the clock with complete disregard to safety."

 artist_events.14.title: "Catastrophic Legitimacy Campaign"
 artist_events.14.desc: "Our recent attempts to legitimize our aggressiveness toward our neighbors have met with an obstacle. Arguably, the poor attempt to justify our conquests via the erection of art by [target_character.GetName] has been incredibly ineffective and, as a result, our relations with bordering countries have deteriorated."
 artist_events.14.a: "[target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip] you fool!"

 artist_events.15.title: "The Department of Sculpture Arts"
 artist_events.15.desc: "Our art academy in the beautiful [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetRank.GetName] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] has recently opened up a new section displaying various works of art on marble, wood, and clay.

 artist_events.16.a: "We will watch your career with great interest!"

 artist_events.17.title: "Halls of Noise"
 artist_events.17.desc: "Day in and day out, our halls are filled with a terrifying mixture of screams, badly played chords, and off-key singing. One might assume we apply the most excruciating torture to our prisoners, but the truth is far more horrid. [target_character.GetName] is composing [target_character.GetHerHis] latest work, unfortunately..."
 artist_events.17.a: "Silence this fool!"
 artist_events.17.b: "Beauty in the ear of the beholder."

 artist_events.19.title: "Musical Duel"
 artist_events.19.desc: "For the last few weeks, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] has been the battleground between two composers. Each one, armed with wits and musical sheets, attempts to outperform the other. While [target_good_composer.GetName] is a better and well-established artist, [target_bad_composer.GetName] is relentless and has not stopped pestering the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] with constant requests to compare [target_bad_composer.GetHerHis] work with [target_bad_composer.GetHerHis] colleague's."

 artist_events.21.title: "Life in the City"
 artist_events.21.desc: "The development of urban centers across our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] has led to many boons experienced by our society. However, along with this new wave of centralization come the downsides of living in a highly urbanized environment.

 artist_events.23.a: "A great idea."
 artist_events.23.b: "We think not."

 artist_events.24.title: "An Error in the Numbers"
 artist_events.24.desc: "Our suppliers for construction materials could swear they were given orders to send off several more caravans full of iron, marble, stone, and clay as per the instructions of [target_character.GetName]. It appears that this order was unnecessary, yet the merchants insist that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] must reimburse the materials and their traveling expenses, as ordained by their guild contract."
 artist_events.24.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('common_string_negative')]"
 artist_events.24.b: "This is not our error to correct."

 artist_events.25.title: "The Mother of Learning"

 artist_events.26.title: "Heated Debates"
 artist_events.26.desc: "Raised tones and loud arguments are no uncommon occurrences in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle]. As we attempt to host various individuals of standing in the artistic and theoretical scope, we must expect a fair amount of friction between these intellectual folk. However, recent debates around nature, nurture, and the human mind have turned [target_character.GetName] near feral, angrily pacing around the gardens of the palace, pointing at the maids or various supplicants and asking them aggressive questions, challenging them to debates."
 artist_events.26.a: "We are better than this."
 artist_events.26.b: "It is but a sign of our vibrant culture and love for intellectual arts!"

 artist_events.28.title: "Provoking Divine Wrath"
 artist_events.28.desc: "The work of philosophers like [target_character.GetName] often walks a fine line between hubris and heresy.

Despite the works finishing somewhat early, they have been incredibly vocal regarding the lack of care, professionalism, and expertise that is evident upon looking at the iconographer's work. Their anger may bring unforeseen consequences as they hold much sway in religious matters within our society."
 artist_events.33.a: "We can cover the iconographer's expenses on their behalf."
 artist_events.33.b: "It is but a part of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName]'s plan, who are we to interfere?"

 artist_events.35.title: "All that Shines"
 artist_events.35.desc: "In [target_character.GetHerHis] amateurish attempts to capture the divine essence of our ensemble of saints, [target_character.GetName] has produced a series of very poorly made icons of unnatural proportions and visages dressed in some of the most bright and unsettling golden colors. So much is the unsightfulness of them, that many [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] resorted to launching various fruit towards both the artist and the art pieces in question, a truly embarrassing sight."
 artist_events.35.a: "How embarrassing!"

 artist_events.36.title: "Honing Skills"
 artist_events.36.desc: "For quite some time, [target_character.GetName] has been inquiring in a potential sponsorship that would help [target_character.GetHerHis] metallurgical skills.

 artist_events.43.desc: "Our society has long been shaped by our support for the arts and strength in legal foundations. Famed for [target_character.GetHerHis] eloquent speeches and literary achievements in the domain of jurisprudence, [target_character.GetName] has carved a great age of progress across the artistic fields as a great jurist. We must therefore contemplate how to best utilize such talent and employ [target_character.GetHerHim] to maximize our perceived prestige and legitimacy."
 artist_events.43.a: "[target_character.GetSheHe|U] is a shining example of our healthy apparatus."

 artist_events.44.desc: "Our laws govern justly across our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. Even against those who seek to undo our progress and tear us down, jurisdprudence offers a kind hand without prejudice.\n\nSuch is the case of the [target_rebel.GetName] and their supporters. The thoughtful approach to legal protections of [target_character.GetName] has helped sway many away from rebellious tendencies, giving us a chance to influence them as we see fit."

 artist_events.45.desc: "It appears that [target_character.GetName] has recently represented prominent members of the [target_estate.GetName] in court, earning them favorable results. As a reward, they have made a generous donation to our coffers. While this monetary benefit will surely further our wealth, our advisors are eager to suggest countless ways to properly invest our newfound coin."
 artist_events.45.a: "We thank them for their gift!"
 artist_events.45.b: "Invest the coin to bolster the abilities of [target_character.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]."

 artist_events.46.title: "An Unexpected Sneeze"
 artist_events.46.desc: "While [target_artist.GetName] was hard at work in [target_artist.GetHerHis] commission, one of [target_artist.GetHerHis] assistants came to [target_artist.GetHerHim] to present the latest shipment of [ShowGoodsName('pepper')]. Unfortunately, black pepper makes one sneeze, and the sudden outburst made [target_artist.GetNameWithNoTooltip] spill ink all over. [target_artist.GetHerHis|U] work has been irremediably ruined by random splotches and smudges, and all previously meticulously traced lines have lost their proper shapes, and there may not be other choice than to start again from scratch."
 artist_events.46.a: "We will supply [target_artist.GetNameWithNoTooltip] with extra materials."

 artist_events.47.desc: "[target_artist.GetName] has always been regarded as an established [target_artist.GetArtistType.GetName] and [target_artist.GetHerHis] works lauded by the general populace. However, one of [target_artist.GetHerHis] works, [target_art.GetName], has become the main topic of discussion at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle], when some attentive students of the work discovered some particular ink smudges on it. Apparently, a cat walked on it after having stepped on ink, leaving its paws permanently imprinted on the piece.\n\nThis has caused a most curious debate at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle], with the [cat_lovers.GetName] admiring the intrepidness of the feline, while the [cat_haters.GetName] lamenting that now the piece is completely ruined."
 artist_events.47.a: "As the [cat_haters.GetNameWithNoTooltip] say, the cat ruined it."
 artist_events.47.b: "This does not diminish the piece, it even gives it more history."
 artist_events.47.c: "It is clear that [target_art.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will have to be replaced."

 artist_events.48.title: "An Irreverent [target_artist.GetArtistType.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 artist_events.48.desc: "Although [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetName] clearly discourages artistic depictions of people and animals to avoid idolatry, they are not explicitly forbidden. Often, artists have found a way to avoid the depictions of images by using calligraphic composition itself to suggest the idea of images rather than explicitly drawing them. This has more than once raised some eyebrows among the most zealous of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')]. However, some lines must never be crossed.\n\n[target_artist.GetName] has gained [target_artist.GetHerHim] more than raised eyebrows with [target_artist.GetHerHis] work, which evokes the most vivid images of not only people and animals, but even divine prophets and messengers and Muḥammad himself, peace be upon him. This has caused the ire of most of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')], who ask for a severe condemnation."
 artist_events.48.a: "Forbid [target_artist.GetNameWithNoTooltip] from creating such images again."
 artist_events.48.b: "There is no actual damage done by them."
 artist_events.48.c: "[target_artist.GetNameWithNoTooltip] is no longer welcome in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."

 artist_events.49.title: "Horrible Handwriting"
 artist_events.49.desc: "[target_artist.GetName] calls [target_artist.GetHerselfHimself] a proud [target_artist.GetArtistType.GetName]. However, the reality is that [target_artist.GetHerHis] handwriting is absolutely awful, with many at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] not being able to understand even a single word of what [target_artist.GetSheHe] writes. [target_artist.GetHerHis|U] works often gather more troubled expressions and contorted faces than looks of admiration, a fact [target_artist.GetSheHe] seems to remain completely oblivious to, picturing [target_artist.GetHerselfHimself] instead as a misunderstood artist due [target_artist.GetHerHis] works being too advanced."
 artist_events.49.a: "It is time for a reality check."
 artist_events.49.b: "The plebs cannot understand true art."

 artist_events.50.desc: "[target_artist.GetName] appeared to be sufficiently pleased with [target_artist.GetHerHis] work in [target_art.GetName], but in reality [target_artist.GetSheHe] was internally disappointed by it. Now, [target_artist.GetSheHe] has come to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] with an idea on how to improve it. [target_artist.GetSheHe|U] claims that if we provide [target_artist.GetHerHim] some [ShowGoodsName('goods_gold')], [target_artist.GetSheHe] may be able to retrace the lines with a special mixture of ink and gold powder, greatly increasing the beauty of the work."
 artist_events.50.a: "Nonsense, it is a fine work as it is now."
 artist_events.50.b: "Let us get [target_artist.GetHerHim] some [ShowGoodsNameWithNoTooltip('goods_gold')]."

 artist_events.51.title: "A New Calligraphic Style"
 artist_events.51.desc: "There is no doubt that [target_artist.GetName] is a renowned [target_artist.GetArtistType.GetName]. [target_artist.GetHerHis|U] written words have always inspired admiration, but it seems that [target_artist.GetSheHe] wanted to go further. In [target_artist.GetHerHis] study, [target_artist.GetSheHe] has started using a new style of writing, which [target_artist.GetSheHe] claims may become the new standard if properly promoted and diffused."
 artist_events.51.a: "Encourage the promotion of this new style."
 artist_events.51.b: "We already have a standard, no need for a new one."

 artist_events.52.title: "Writing Meditation"
 artist_events.52.desc: "[target_artist.GetName] is always hard at work, but [target_artist.GetHerHis] technique has garnered [target_artist.GetHerHim] the interest of a particular group. Some among the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] see [target_artist.GetHerHis] way of working silently and focused as a way of moving meditation, and want to promote it among the rest of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] as another way to help follow the path of the Buddha."
 artist_events.52.a: "It is indeed a very spiritual activity."
 artist_events.52.b: "It is a way to create beautiful art, nothing more."

 artist_events.53.title: "The Master and the Apprentice"
 artist_events.53.desc: "In any artistic endeavor, there are always two, a master and an apprentice, and is the objective of the apprentice to eventually surpass the master. To that effect, [target_apprentice.GetName] has appeared before the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle], dissatisfied with [target_apprentice.GetHerHis] own abilities. [target_apprentice.GetSheHe|U] asks that we allow [target_apprentice.GetHerHim] come under the apprenticeship of [target_artist.GetName], who is a much more renowned and skilled [target_artist.GetArtistType.GetName]. That would clearly help [target_apprentice.GetHerHim] improve [target_artist.GetHerHis] abilities, but would certainly keep [target_artist.GetNameWithNoTooltip] unable to perform [target_artist.GetHerHis] other responsibilities."
 artist_events.53.a: "Allow [target_apprentice.GetHerHim] to take apprenticeship."
 artist_events.53.b: "[target_artist.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s skills are too valuable for such apprenticeship."
