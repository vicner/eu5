 personality_events.1.title: "The many Interests of [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 personality_events.1.desc: "Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has grown increasingly interested in the higher intellectual pursuits and can spend days talking to the learned men of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle]. [target_ruler.GetHeSheFormal|U] has started inviting scholars from near and far to help [target_ruler.GetHerHim] better understand how the world and the people in it function.\n\nThe way things are developing, [target_ruler.GetName] [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] could probably become an authority in [target_ruler.GetHerHis] own right if [target_ruler.GetSheHe] could spend enough time and resources on the areas of [target_ruler.GetHerHis] choice."
 personality_events.1.a: "We must strive to understand the physical world around us."
 personality_events.1.a.tt: "This may benefit our country, but most likely costs us [gold|e]"
 personality_events.1.b: "A ruler must understand the laws of god and men."
 personality_events.1.c: "Let us not waste [target_ruler.GetHerHis] time and money with such matters."
 personality_events.2.title: "Advances in Cartography"
 personality_events.2.desc: "A devoted student of the world around [target_ruler.GetHerHim], [target_ruler.GetName] has come to be obsessed with maps. [target_ruler.GetHerHis|U] palace in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] has rooms entirely devoted to [target_ruler.GetHerHis] map collection and our dear [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] is spending quite some time staring at them and cataloging them.\n\nWhile this has made [target_ruler.GetHerHim] a bit odd in the eyes of [target_ruler.GetHerHis] courtiers (and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective|U] treasurer), our country is benefiting from the great archive [target_ruler.GetSheHe] has built up about the world around us."
 personality_events.2.a: "The world is such a big place."
 personality_events.3.title: "Advances in Gunsmithing"
 personality_events.3.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName] has taken a great interest in the function and form of guns. Considerable effort has been spent tracking down unusual or innovative firearms and [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will gleefully disassemble and rebuild any weapon brought to [target_ruler.GetHerHim].\n\nSome would consider this fascination morbid (not to mention expensive), but as the result of this long-standing project, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has created what [target_ruler.GetSheHe] claims is the perfect firearm."
 personality_events.3.a: "Let the world tremble!"
 personality_events.4.title: "The Pursuit of Gold"
 personality_events.4.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName] has been absorbed by the possibility of creating gold ever since [target_ruler.GetHerHis] early childhood, and with the government coffers open to [target_ruler.GetHerHim] this has grown into an obsession. Every book and supposed expert has been gathered to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] to be examined or questioned. [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] has spent many days in [target_ruler.GetHerHis] laboratory but has so far not come close to creating this expensive metal.\n\nSome would call this pursuit a fool's errand, but it has certainly improved our knowledge about Chemistry."
 personality_events.4.a: "Excellent, let us try to tone this down now."
 personality_events.4.b: "Must... Create Gold..."
 personality_events.4.b.tt: "Give our ruler free reins to pursue alchemy. Chances of success are very uncertain."
 personality_events.5.title: "Pursuit of a Hobby"
 personality_events.5.desc: "While [target_ruler.GetName] has taken a great interest in all kinds of intellectual pursuits throughout [target_ruler.GetHerHis] rule, it seems [target_ruler.GetHerHis] ambition to make a name for [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] among the scholars of the world has not been very successful. [target_ruler.GetHerHis|U] patronage of greater intellects is not without merit for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] as a whole, even if [target_ruler.GetHerHis] failed ambition remains a sore point to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]."
 personality_events.5.a: "#italic Dicitur nos esse quasi nanos, gigantium humeris insidentes.#!"
 personality_events.5.b: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will surround [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] with the great minds of our age!"
 personality_events.6.title: "Codification of Laws"
 personality_events.6.desc: "After intense study and debate, [target_ruler.GetName] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has decreed that a number of local laws and legal traditions from all over [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will be replaced by a new collection of laws of [target_ruler.GetHerHis] making.\n\nThis compilation of law combines the jurisprudence from all over our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], as well as other [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] countries, and [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] believes it will act as an example to judges for generations to come."
 personality_events.6.a: "Everyone has the right to a fair trial."
 personality_events.6.b: "We can get used to this..."
 personality_events.7.title: "The Great Debate of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 personality_events.7.desc: "In order to fully understand what rules govern a land and its inhabitants, [target_ruler.GetName] has immersed [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] in the great works of theology and philosophy. A great number of scholars have also been brought to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] to give their view on the order of things in the world.\n\nThis pursuit of guidance has now culminated in a great debate hosted by our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 personality_events.7.a: "What a great day for learning!"
 personality_events.7.b: "We must look further for answers."
 personality_events.8.title: "What is Right in War and Peace"
 personality_events.8.desc: "In [target_ruler.GetHerHis] pursuit of justice, [target_ruler.GetName] has come to interest [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] in the relations between great states. The conduct of states while at war, at sea, or otherwise far from home is governed by few laws, but many traditions. Determined to shape the international debate on these matters, [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] has drawn from all material [target_ruler.GetSheHe] has been able to find to write a book on the laws of war, peace, and international conduct. It is still not clear if this will make the difference our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] hopes it will, but it has clearly made a difference to the standing of our country among other states."
 personality_events.8.a: "What Constitutes a Valid Casus Belli?"
 personality_events.9.title: "A Potion of Mana?"
 personality_events.9.desc: "The secret to creating gold out of some lesser material has continued to elude [target_ruler.GetName], but in [target_ruler.GetHerHis] experiments [target_ruler.GetSheHe] has managed to create something [target_ruler.GetSheHe] refers to as a 'Mana Potion'. Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] insists that drinking this potion will bring [target_ruler.GetHerHim] life and vitality, not to mention the power to do great things for our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
 personality_events.9.a: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will Drink the Mana Potion!"
 personality_events.10.title: "Provincial Feud"
 personality_events.10.desc: "What started as a dispute of minor concern between some local strongmen and some of their tenants, has somehow grown into a dispute of national importance. With [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')], scholars, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')], and street demagogues all sharing their opinions as loudly as possible, the parties of the feud have finally turned to [target_ruler.GetName] to have their conflict solved.\n\nHaving heard them plead their cases, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] is convinced that the tenants, however deplorable their situation, are the ones at fault. A just and well argued verdict is unlikely to upset anyone, but it is quite tempting to use public opinion to increase our own authority over the province at these strongmen's expense."
 personality_events.10.a: "Try to settle the issue justly."
 personality_events.10.b: "We must exploit this situation!"
 personality_events.11.title: "A Righteous [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]"
 personality_events.11.desc: "There are few monarchs who can boast such a fervent supporter base as [target_ruler.GetName]. However, [target_ruler.GetHerHis] deputies are not always as fortunate. In some cases, our subjects simply refuse to accept that a particular governor, tax collector, or other government official is acting on [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s behalf. A petition has reached us about an entire gubernatorial administration which, according to popular belief, has been abusing our good will while making the people suffer."
 personality_events.11.a: "Chastise the gubernatorial administration."
 personality_events.11.b: "Attempt to defend the gubernatorial administration."
 personality_events.11.c: "Leave it to the locals to handle."
 personality_events.12.title: "The Virtues of a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]"
 personality_events.12.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName]'s rule is marked by remarkable cooperation, from the bureaucrats to the simple traders and even the republican aristocracy, everyone seems to feel that our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has their good at heart. There is one group, however, that feel that [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] has let them down. [target_ruler.GetHerHis|U] own family and supporters feel [target_ruler.GetSheHe] has not made enough use of [target_ruler.GetHerHis] office. Their property and influence is substantial even if it has not grown much during [target_ruler.GetHerHis] time in office and many insist that they could do great things for the republic if granted the opportunity."
 personality_events.12.a: "We must fight all forms of Nepotism!"
 personality_events.12.b: "Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s own flesh and blood can be trusted."
 personality_events.12.c: "Continue to dodge [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s relatives."
 personality_events.13.title: "The Trusting Nature of [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 personality_events.13.desc: "Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] is famously tolerant of the non-[ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] communities in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. Some would even say [target_ruler.GetHeSheFormal] is too trusting and allows these non-believers to cloud [target_ruler.GetHerHis] judgment. A group of [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s close infidel confidants have in particular attracted much jealousy and ill-will. Rumors have started circulating that our dear [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s favorites have infiltrated the government in order to plot against the faithful."
 personality_events.13.a: "Nonsense!"
 personality_events.13.b: "How could [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] have been so blind?"
 personality_events.14.title: "Ravages of War"
 personality_events.14.desc: "Wars leave deep scars which linger with new subjects long after the conclusion of a conflict. In areas particularly badly affected by the ravages of war, little may be left of prior government institutions or even locals' extended families. [target_ruler.GetName] has personally expressed worries that demagogues will whip up separatism and discord in such areas, hampering their integration into the wider state and causing undue suffering to the people."
 personality_events.14.a: "We must help these poor people rebuild their lives!"
 personality_events.14.b: "Let us instead use the devastation to our advantage!"
 personality_events.14.c: "Local authorities are handling it."
 personality_events.15.title: "Heresiarch?"
 personality_events.15.desc: "A strange man named [heresiarch.GetName] has been spotted in the countryside at various locations around our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. He is teaching a most unorthodox version of the creation of the world to whoever will listen to his jovial ramblings. According to some, [heresiarch.GetNameWithNoTooltip] represents a dangerous and vile reinterpretation of holy teachings, but many of our subjects seem to have been taken in by the heresy of this would-be prophet and his ideas.\n\nIntrigued by the reputation of [target_ruler.GetName] as a free thinking [target_ruler.GetWomanMan], [heresiarch.GetNameWithNoTooltip] is now demanding an audience with our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], offering to act as an advisor in spiritual matters."
 personality_events.15.a: "The world as a cheese with worms? Fascinating perspective!"
 personality_events.15.b: "We cannot allow [heresiarch.GetNameWithNoTooltip] to make a mockery of our faith!"
 personality_events.15.c: "Just show [heresiarch.GetNameWithNoTooltip] the door."
 personality_events.16.title: "The Dynamic [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCabinetTitle|U] of [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 personality_events.16.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName] has made it [target_ruler.GetHerHis] business to know all men and women of quality in our day and age. This has allowed [target_ruler.GetHerHim] to gather a most impressive [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCabinetTitle] of the brightest minds of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. As those around [target_ruler.GetHerHim] realize what a great way this can be to further a career, [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] has been approached by many in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCabinetTitle] who ask that [target_ruler.GetSheHe] make room for one of their protégés. Most are not of interest, but one particularly witty and intelligent candidate, [protege.GetName], might just be worthy of a place in our inner circle."
 personality_events.16.a: "A remarkable brain, and we should like to plunder it."
 personality_events.16.b: "Surely we can make room somewhere in our administration for [protege.GetNameWithNoTooltip]?"
 personality_events.17.title: "Leading by Example"
 personality_events.17.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName] is not a [target_ruler.GetWomanMan] to easily lose [target_ruler.GetHerHis] composure. In times of upheaval, strife, or conflict, [target_ruler.GetSheHe] has always stood firmly and strongly, avoiding panic and inspiring others to keep their calm. Over time, this has filtered down to the lowest levels of our administration and our country is much more stable because of it."
 personality_events.17.a: "Stand Firm."
 personality_events.18.title: "Careful Maneuvering"
 personality_events.18.desc: "As the ruler of an ambitious state, it is hard to make friends with everyone. However, sometimes paying careful attention to what is going on in the international community allows one to lessen the impact of past slights. In [target_ruler.GetHerHis] personal correspondence with the rulers of neighboring states, [target_ruler.GetName] hopes to improve our standing in the world little by little."
 personality_events.18.a: "We are really just misunderstood."
 personality_events.18.a.tt: "All neighboring [countries|e] who have a negative opinion of our country while being at peace with us gain [ShowBiasValue('careful_diplomatic_manouvering')|+=] [opinion|e] of us."
 personality_events.19.title: "The Great Cipher of [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 personality_events.19.desc: "Ever since [target_ruler.GetHerHis] childhood, cryptography has been a hobby of [target_ruler.GetName] and as [target_ruler.GetSheHe] has matured so too have [target_ruler.GetHerHis] methods of concealing [target_ruler.GetHerHis] secrets. After the discovery of a series of opened letters, it has become clear that unwanted eyes read our correspondence with the provincial governors. Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] is confident that [target_ruler.GetSheHe] could increase security substantially if given the resources to do so."
 personality_events.19.a: "Let us make this our top priority!"
 personality_events.19.b: "Let us not waste energy on this. The method will just spread eventually."
 personality_events.20.title: "Friends in Low Places"
 personality_events.20.desc: "It is said that every other performer, artist, or thief in the capitals of our rivals is really an informant of [target_ruler.GetName]. With a keen personal interest in the comings and goings of just about anyone with any influence, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] often sees opportunities long before our chief of espionage does. Lately, the contacts of [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] have indicated that there are openings we might be able to use in countries of interest. This would require us to open the state coffers a bit however."
 personality_events.20.a: "Money is just a number."
 personality_events.20.b: "Let us leave the spying to professionals."
 personality_events.23.title: "Learning from the Mistakes of Others"
 personality_events.23.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName] has always considered it a virtue to listen to the advice of those that came before [target_ruler.GetHerHim] and to surround [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] with experienced advisors. It worries [target_ruler.GetHerHim], however, that [target_heir.GetName] might not fully realize what ruling [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] entails. At some point, this is a responsibility that [target_heir.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will have to shoulder, and at that time it would probably be best if [target_heir.GetSheHe] had been more thoroughly introduced to the challenges of rulership."
 personality_events.23.a: "We must teach [target_heir.GetHerHim] about Administration."
 personality_events.23.b: "We must teach [target_heir.GetHerHim] about Foreign Affairs."
 personality_events.23.c: "We must teach [target_heir.GetHerHim] about War."
 personality_events.23.d: "[target_heir.GetNameWithNoTooltip] is perfectly prepared as is!"
 personality_events.24.title: "Never too Late to Learn?"
 personality_events.24.desc: "Realizing one's own deficiencies and delegating to competent people that complement one's own abilities is one of the most important aspects of sound rulership. [target_ruler.GetName] is a firm believer in listening to good advice and in improving [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] by listening to those more experienced. Over time, however, it may be possible to learn what comes natural to others. If we allow [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] to devote [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] fully, a tutor would likely be able to improve [target_ruler.GetHerHis] grasp of some of the more advanced parts of the running of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] state."
 personality_events.24.a: "Let [target_ruler.GetHerHim] study the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] Administration"
 personality_events.24.b: "Let [target_ruler.GetHerHim] study Foreign Affairs."
 personality_events.24.c: "Let [target_ruler.GetHerHim] study War."
 personality_events.24.d: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] needs no tutor!"
 personality_events.25.title: "Unjust War"
 personality_events.25.desc: "As negotiations draw closer in our current war, [target_ruler.GetName] has been busy meeting with the envoys of our mutual friends and rivals. We have the sympathy of the international community as the defenders against an unfair war of aggression. Nothing is settled yet, but we can be sure to have plenty of leverage in future negotiations."
 personality_events.25.a: "Time to make a deal."
 personality_events.25.b: "What we need is help to rebuild."
 personality_events.26.title: "Expansion of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip|U] Faith"
 personality_events.26.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName] has made it [target_ruler.GetHerHis] life work to spread the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] faith and has quickly made a name for [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] among religious communities across our country. [target_ruler.GetHerHis|U] close ties to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] have made religious scholars of various kinds a common sight in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and an influential voice in the halls of power.\n\nOver time, the fame of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has begun to spread even beyond our borders. Now, our spies tell us that there are religious minorities among the subjects of our rivals who would welcome our liberating armies into their lands."
 personality_events.26.a: "We must defend our religious brethren!"
 personality_events.26.a.tt: "All neighboring [countries|e] who follow a [religion|e] from a different religion group than us gain [ShowBiasValue('zealot_reputation_opinion')|+=] [opinion|e] of us."
 personality_events.26.b: "Let us avoid unnecessary bloodshed."
 personality_events.27.title: "Support of the Pious"
 personality_events.27.desc: "Many are contributing what little they have to strengthen our state and our pious leader in [target_ruler.GetHerHis] struggle against the unfaithful. Our local [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] also report a surge of volunteers ready to take up arms to fight against the enemies of the faith."
 personality_events.27.a: "Our prayers have been answered."
 personality_events.27.b: "The most able-bodied will serve in our armies."
 personality_events.28.title: "The Draw of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 personality_events.28.desc: "At best, a vassal-patron relationship is a mutually beneficial affair where both parties can make further gains than would otherwise be possible. Under the firm hand of [target_ruler.GetName], many of the countries enjoying our protection have thrived. One of many benefits this brings us is that young princes and other notables from subject countries consider [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] a good place to forge a career."
 personality_events.28.a: "Let them compete for the honor to serve in our administration."
 personality_events.28.b: "The most talented will be given the right to serve in our armies."
 personality_events.29.title: "Legal Reform"
 personality_events.29.desc: "Like many states of similar size, the outward unity of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is partly a mirage. Locally, any city, estate, or even village may have its own rules and laws since time immemorial. Eager to reduce inconsistent legislation in our country, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has been withdrawing privileges and issuing new, nationwide, directives to bring order to the chaos. This is, however, not always immediately successful. With a recent government directive outright being ignored in one part of our country, [target_ruler.GetName]'s authority is in question."
 personality_events.29.a: "Analyze their objections and thoroughly harmonize our legislation."
 personality_events.30.title: "Finding Money in Unexpected Places"
 personality_events.30.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName] is well known for [target_ruler.GetHerHis] unsurpassed ability to find new sources of state income in the unlikeliest of places. [target_ruler.GetHerHis|U] recent audit of local reports has turned up an entirely new source of revenue in one of our provinces, slowly but surely increasing the stream of money into state coffers."
 personality_events.30.a: "Money!"
 personality_events.31.title: "Keeping to the Code"
 personality_events.31.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName]'s strict enforcement and views regarding ethical conduct and corruption has helped make our state a more honest place. It is also not earning [target_ruler.GetHerHim] many friends among our administrators and clerks. While we have deterred from taking bribes, many are actively working to slow down the cogs of our government through all the means available to them."
 personality_events.31.a: "In time, we will have rooted them all out."
 personality_events.31.b: "We can afford to bend our high principles a bit."
 personality_events.32.title: "School of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 personality_events.32.desc: "The silhouette of our capital has not been as full of cranes, half-built towers, and monuments in generations. The rule of [target_ruler.GetName] has been characterized by an ever-increasing number of building projects both in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and in other parts of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank].\n\nThe increasing number of people employed in planning and erecting great buildings to the taste of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has led to the development of a new and distinct architectural style. The demand for the great architects and builders of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetNameWithNoTooltip] school is increasing internationally and some foreign cities can now compete with us in our own style."
 personality_events.32.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetNameWithNoTooltip] must remain the grandest of cities!"
 personality_events.32.b: "Let us encourage our masters to spread this style further abroad."
 personality_events.33.title: "The Lure of Easy Money"
 personality_events.33.desc: "A number of economic investors have approached [target_ruler.GetName] asking for the right to develop one of the areas under our control. They would pay a lump sum for the right to extract revenue from our lands and it would then be up to them to collect the money in our stead. The investors are quick to point out that it is in their interest to invest in the local infrastructure to increase the chances that they will make more than the sum they have paid for the right to our land."
 personality_events.33.a: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] knows a good deal when [target_ruler.GetSheHe] sees one!"
 personality_events.33.b: "Better play it safe."
 personality_events.34.title: "Economics of a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]"
 personality_events.34.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName] is well known for [target_ruler.GetHerHis] ceaseless energy and working habits. There are few hours in the night when the lights in [target_ruler.GetHerHis] chambers are not burning and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] decrees are known to leave [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] both early in the mornings and late in the evenings. [target_ruler.GetSheHe|U] also seems to keep a constant watch over all business sectors in our country. Foreigners have sometimes been amazed to learn that [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will personally create regulations for even entirely new business ventures in the provinces.\n\nAs our dear [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] gets hold of new opportunities for growth in our country, the only question is really if we have the resources to do all [target_ruler.GetSheHe] wishes at the same time."
 personality_events.34.a: "Money is not a problem."
 personality_events.34.b: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] shall have what [target_ruler.GetSheHe] needs and more."
 personality_events.34.c: "Another time perhaps."
 personality_events.35.title: "The Lure of New Worlds"
 personality_events.35.desc: "Ever since [target_ruler.GetHerHis] childhood, [target_ruler.GetName] has been fascinated by the tales of far-away places and as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], [target_ruler.GetSheHe] has been actively promoting voyages of discovery and colonization. As our colonial administrators now demand that we give them more support to fulfill our overseas ambitions, [target_ruler.GetSheHe] has decided to raise the needed resources on [target_ruler.GetHerHis] own without burdening the coffers of the state."
 personality_events.35.a: "It is time to mount an expedition!"
 personality_events.36.title: "Government Intervention"
 personality_events.36.desc: "The talents of [target_ruler.GetName] as a negotiator and broker are generally an asset in international negotiations, but sometimes an opportunity arises that can be used to benefit our markets. A recent series of meetings with foreign emissaries have revealed an opportunity to give our domestic merchants leverage when exporting goods to foreign markets."
 personality_events.36.a: "Focus on a Mercantlist Agenda."
 personality_events.36.b: "Favor Free Trade."
 personality_events.36.c: "A [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] is above such matters."
 personality_events.37.title: "Fear and Awe"
 personality_events.37.desc: "During [target_ruler.GetHerHis] rule, [target_ruler.GetName] has by both word and action proven [target_ruler.GetHerHis] ambitions as a Conqueror. Admired by the troops, an impromptu visit to an army encampment is now instilling a glorious dream of victory in the hearts of our soldiers."
 personality_events.37.a: "A [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s presence shall drive them to triumph!"
 personality_events.37.b: "We should compose marching songs in [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s name!"
 personality_events.38.title: "The Art of War"
 personality_events.38.desc: "This age has seen few individuals with a tactical mind to rival that of our illustrious [target_ruler.GetName]. [target_ruler.GetSheHe|U] has revolutionized the way we approach the battlefield and we foresee many great victories in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]'s future. [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] is contemplating writing a book on [target_ruler.GetHerHis] methods. While this would help us spread knowledge on military tactics within our own army, it would surely reach our neighbors as well."
 personality_events.38.a: "To not share this progress would be a crime against mankind!"
 personality_events.38.a.tt: "All neighboring countries will gain [ShowNamedValue('army_tradition_mild_bonus')|+=0] [army_tradition|e]."
 personality_events.38.b: "They would celebrate us today, only to stab us in the back tomorrow."
 personality_events.39.title: "All Peace and No Play"
 personality_events.39.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName] has been pacing around [target_ruler.GetHerHis] quarters lately. Gossip says that it is matters of the heart making the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] anxious, but anybody familiar with the [target_ruler.GetWomanMan] would know that it's actually the current peace of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] - a brave warrior such as [target_ruler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] feels cooped up like a bird in [target_ruler.GetHerHis] rooms whenever there is no war to strategize over. Then again, [target_ruler.GetSheHe] is the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]..."

The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] believes the time has come for [target_ruler.GetHerHis] newest pupil, [protege.GetName], to test [protege.GetHerHis] wings.

In the end, most people give [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] whatever [target_ruler.GetSheHe] wants just in order to escape [target_ruler.GetHerHis] iron gaze. When our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] summoned the bankers to renegotiate the nation's loans, we all knew how it would end."

Their most recent headache came when our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] infuriated the emissary of [angry_ruler.GetName] of [angry_country.GetName] to such an extent that [angry_ruler.GetSheHe] threw a tantrum during [angry_ruler.GetHerHis] visit.

Why not make use of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s 'talents' to refill the coffers?"
 personality_events.46.a: "It is for the good of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]!"
