 dynastic.1.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has found [ruler_char.GetHerselfHimself] entranced by a certain [devil_char.GetName] whose figure haunts the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] halls by day and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s dreams by night. The temptation is becoming too much for [ruler_char.GetHerHim] to bear, but in the end, only fate can decide whether [ruler_char.GetShortName] will have to seek forgiveness for more than thoughts this Sunday."

 dynastic.2.desc: "A strange fever has claimed the life of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s beloved [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle].

 dynastic.3.title: "Palace Coup"
 dynastic.3.desc: "[heir_char.GetShortName]'s sword sweeps out from its sheath; the blade now pointing squarely towards the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]. Having finally made [heir_char.GetHerHis] move against the throne, which [heir_char.GetSheHe] believes to have long been mismanaged, [heir_char.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] looks nervously at [heir_char.GetHerHis] co-conspirators. All the while, an other-worldly sense of fatigue washes over the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] who knows there can be no painless solution to this crisis."

[ruler_char.GetSheHe|U] says nothing. Spring is in the air, and as [ruler_char.GetSheHe] leans in toward her, with the intoxicating scent of her perfume painfully present, a thought crosses [ruler_char.GetHerHis] mind."
 dynastic.5.a: "Make [young_female.GetNameWithNoTooltip] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsortTitle]."

 dynastic.5.c: "Spring never lasts..."

 dynastic.6.desc: "The chandeliers blaze shadows and light across the grand ballroom of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] palace, and the music of a hundred dancing [ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('GetContemporaryStringedInstrumentPlural')] fills the air. The foreign guests and local dignitaries greet [ruler_char.GetHerHim] with jubilation. Everywhere is conversation, laughter, discussion, and the breathing, pulsating rhythm of life. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s eyes gaze across the assembled myriads, contemplating whom [ruler_char.GetSheHe] should talk to tonight."

 dynastic.6001.title: "The Consequences of our Actions"
 dynastic.6001.desc: "It seems that the revelling that [ruler_char.GetName] enjoyed recently was not without consequences, as [ruler_char.GetHerHis] encounter with [hookup_char.GetName] resulted in the birth of a child. It is now in question how the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] will accept [target_child.GetName]."
 dynastic.6001.a: "Everybody knows of the slip now."
 dynastic.6001.b: "It is obviously the [target_child.GetDaughterSon] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetConsort.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."

 dynastic.7.desc: "[target_child.GetName|U] breathes heavily. [target_child.GetHeSheFormal|U] has been lying in bed for three days now, and reflected in the beads of sweat on [target_child.GetHerHis] forehead is the fear in [target_child.GetHerHis] attendant's eyes for [target_child.GetHerHis] life. [target_child.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip|U] might not make it through the night unless something is done."

 dynastic.8.desc: "Suddenly, something startles the animal, and before the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has time to fire, it is long gone. [ruler_char.GetSheHe|U] looks around. The water in the small creek reflects the sunlight of a perfect day, and the reeds wave slowly before a light breeze. Is that laughter? [ruler_char.GetSheHe|U] realizes now what had startled the animal. In a cradle, floating among the reeds, lies a laughing little boy. Judging by his smile, one would say that he has never known fear in his life."
 dynastic.8.a: "Adopt him as the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s own."
 dynastic.8.b: "Where did that deer go?"
 dynastic.9.title: "Jousting Tournament"
 dynastic.9.desc: "The proud banners of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] flutter in the wind, and gilded trumpets blow four blast salutes, honoring the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]'s equestrian elites. The air is filled with the smells of roasted almonds, horses, and intrigue. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] cultural and military prominence are truly great boons, and nowhere is this fact more real than here today."

 dynastic.10.title: "Hunting Accident"
 dynastic.10.desc: "[heir_char.GetHerHis|U] body has been draped, by whom none know, in a white cloth now stained red by [heir_char.GetHerHis] lost vitae. They say [heir_char.GetSheHe] was found by [heir_char.GetHerHis] horse, in a clearing in the woods. We know the place they speak of. [heir_char.GetHerHis|U] face is calm, almost serene. The courtiers reach out to touch. The terrible reality of the situation dawns on all. The cold felt by all is that of death."
 dynastic_10_a_helper: "[heir_char.GetName] has died"
 dynastic.10.a: "Sorrow overtakes the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle]."
 dynastic.11.title: "Family Secret?"
 dynastic.11.desc: "The first time, the [ruler_char.GetDynasty.GetName] brush it off, but when it happens a second and a third time, one does begin to wonder. Why are people laughing when they think no one can hear them? After some investigation, an answer is finally obtained from a chambermaid. It appears that [heir_char.GetShortName] has been running about town in a most unchristian fashion, and that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] family is now becoming the laughing stock of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetProvince.GetContinent.GetName]."
 dynastic.11.a: "Scold [heir_char.GetHerHim] publicly."

 dynastic.13.title: "The [ruler_char.GetDynasty.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 dynastic.13.desc: "In another country, a different branch of the [ruler_char.GetDynasty.GetName] family is in dire straits. With their country destabilized, [other_ruler_char.GetName] now struggles to cling on to power. If we do not help [other_ruler_char.GetHerHim] now, [other_ruler_char.GetHerHis] situation might worsen significantly."
 dynastic.13.a: "Family first."

 dynastic.14.desc: "There seems to have been a misunderstanding regarding the heritage of the [disputee_char.GetMotherFather] of [ruler_char.GetName]'s [target_parent.GetMotherFather].

May [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] have mercy on their souls."
 dynastic.18.a: "A house divided cannot stand."
 dynastic.19.title: "Fear and Loathing in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 dynastic.19.desc: "Twilight is always horrid. The clouds racing circles across moonless skies, cruel stars suspended like grains of broken glass, and chandeliers throwing strange shadows across the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] chambers. Lately, a strange sense has come upon the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] that there is something wrong with the place. The geometry of it seems... unsound. Thinking back... it all started with the birth of [heir_char.GetName]."
 dynastic.19.a: "Lord [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName] our Father, thou who art in heaven!"
 dynastic.19.b: "All work and no play makes [ruler_char.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] a dull boy"
 dynastic.20.title: "The Discovery"
 dynastic.20.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] senses instantly that there is something wrong in the attendant's voice as she meekly inquires about a strange wall in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] castle. There is something in her voice, right below the surface. Hidden contempt, and fear.\n\n[ruler_char.GetSheHe|U] remembers it clearly now. How small the body felt. Carrying it down into the damp cellar, laying the bricks. It made [ruler_char.GetHerHim] sick. Sick to the core. Killing [ruler_char.GetHerHis] progeny was not the catharsis [ruler_char.GetSheHe] had expected it to be. For an instant, the flashing glimpse of an insight blows across [ruler_char.GetHerHis] mind..."
 dynastic.20.a: "Heeere's [ruler_char.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]!"
 dynastic.20.b: "Horrific."
 dynastic.21.title: "Danse Macabre"
 dynastic.21.desc: "To the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] chamber is a swirling mist of scents and shapes, coming and going into and out of existence like colorful snowflakes. [ruler_char.GetSheHe|U] is hungry. So very hungry. As if [ruler_char.GetSheHe] had not eaten in months. The stars looking down on [ruler_char.GetHerHim], still suspended in a moonless sky, laugh and dance. They seem free, and wild. There is something about those stars. They seem so... right. [ruler_char.GetSheHe|U] has gone quite insane."
 dynastic.21.a: "[ruler_char.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] would give [ruler_char.GetHerHis] god-damned soul for just a glass of beer."
 dynastic.21.b: "Not by the hair of [ruler_char.GetHerHis] chinny-chin-chin!"
 dynastic.23.title: "Wedding Bells"
 dynastic.23.desc: "Again [advisor_char.GetShortName] interrupts, [advisor_char.GetHerHis] furrowed brow telling tall tales of concern and sleepless nights. On and on [advisor_char.GetSheHe] goes concerning those frivolous matters of 'heirs' and 'stable successions'. This dusty old study and the advisor's dry voice resonating of boredom and wasted potential accentuates the brightness of the clear day outside. Does [advisor_char.GetSheHe] ever stop? There is nothing that could convince [bachelor_char.GetShortName] that marriage is preferable to the promise of a clear sky. After all, in nature, the first step leading an animal into the grave is always procreation."
 dynastic.23.a: "Nature always finds its course."
 dynastic.23.b: "Propose a game of chess on the veranda."
 dynastic.24.title: "A Modest Proposal"
 dynastic.24.desc: "While it is not uncommon among a certain type of [bachelor_char.GetWomanMan] to wish to remain outside the inevitable bonds of wedlock, the bonds are inevitable nevertheless. Looking out from the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s perch, [ruler_char.GetSheHe] spots [ruler_char.GetHerHis] prey. [bachelor_char.GetName] of [bachelor_char.GetCountry.GetName] has for a long time been postponing [bachelor_char.GetHerHis] marriage, and [bachelor_char.GetHerHis] throne lacks a secure succession. This might be the perfect time to form a dynastic bond between our countries. It might be in our interest to dispatch an embassy to try to marry our own [bachelorette_char.GetName] into this foreign [bachelor_country.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] house."
 dynastic.24.a: "Indeed we shall!"
 dynastic.24.b: "We have better things to do."

 dynastic.25.desc: "The ruler of [bachelorette_country.GetName] has sent us a painting, depicting a young girl in [ruler_char.GetHerHis] [bachelorette_country.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle]. [bachelorette_char.GetHerHis|U] eyes are extravagant, [bachelorette_char.GetHerHis] hair is incredible, and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s eyes are drawn to the painting as if to a vacuum. A cunning smile finds its way to an advisor's face. The noise of the room dies down. [bachelor_char.GetName] does not know how long [bachelor_char.GetSheHe] stands there looking at [bachelorette_country.GetHerHis] beauty."
 opinion_dynastic_love: "Love Between Two Families"
 dynastic.25.a: "There could be no finer candidate."
 opinion_dynastic_witchcraft: "Called Princess a Witch"
 dynastic.25.b: "What is this foul witchcraft? Begone!"
 dynastic.26.title: "A Thorn from a Foreign Land"
 dynastic.26.desc: "While the poor quality of the painting might explain away some of it, the fact remains that The Creator was not being overly generous when He endowed this girl with her looks. [bachelorette_country.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] of [bachelorette_country.GetName] has offered her hand in marriage, and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] is not sure if he should laugh or feel insulted. Then again, there is the succession to consider."
 opinion_dynastic_united: "United Dynasties"
 dynastic.26.a: "A good [bachelorette_country.GetReligion.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] woman, no doubt."
 opinion_dynastic_refused: "Refused Marriage Offer"
 dynastic.26.b: "This will obviously not do."
 dynastic.27.title: "The Aftermath"
 dynastic.27.desc: "The anger in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeir.GetShortName]'s voice is unmistakable as [heir_char.GetSheHe] lambasts the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s hand in our wartime catastrophes. True, mistakes were made during recent conflicts, but they were all hardly the fault of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]. Besides, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle] also commanded troops. Reaching [heir_char.GetHerHis] tirade's true purpose, [heir_char.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] at last demands the 'abdication' of [ruler_char.GetName]."
 dynastic.27.a: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] shall accept responsibility"
 dynastic.27.b: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] will not be met with insolence in [ruler_char.GetHerHis] own house!"
 dynastic.28.title: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] Moon"
 dynastic.28.desc: "The garden is bathed in the cool light of a full moon. Turning a corner to come across this sight was not what [target_ruler.GetName] had expected, but here it is. Before [target_ruler.GetHerHim] stands a monument to one of our former wars. The beauty lies not in the exquisite marble, or even in the craftsmanship of the thing, but in the fact that even now, many years later, the monument is still strewn with thousands and thousands of fresh flowers. Here, if nowhere else, the memory of our past, and the memories of the fallen, still lives."
 dynastic.28.a: "May the memory live on"
 dynastic.28.b: "Our sorrow proves the justness of our cause."
 
 dynastic.29.title: "[target_appanage.GetNameWithNoTooltip] Inherited"
 dynastic.29.desc: "The laws of inheritance that dictate politics across our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] are clear. Once the ruler of an [ShowSubjectTypeName('appanage')] is elevated upon our throne, their estates shall be integrated within ours. The way is clear for us to promote a concentration of authority and lands at the hands of [target_ruler.GetName]."
 dynastic.29.a: "Very well, it is time to integrate them."
 dynastic.29.b: "Let us not be hasty."

 dynastic.30.title: "The Elevation of [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 dynastic.30.desc: "In a positive twist of fate, our [target_ruler.GetName] has found [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] at the helm of our overlord, the [target_overlord.GetLongName]. Due to our status of [ShowSubjectTypeName('appanage')] this strongly suggests that our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] is to be integrated diplomatically."
 dynastic.30.a: "Onwards and upwards!"
