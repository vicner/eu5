 colonial_nation.4.title: "Freedom Fighter or Rebel?"
 colonial_nation.4.desc: "A colonel in the army is making a name for himself as a strong proponent of armed resistance against [ROOT.GetCountry.GetDiplomacy.GetOverlord.GetLongName]. Besides being a gifted soldier, he seems to be an inspiring and charismatic leader, and more and more people seem to listen to his ideas of independence.\n\nShould we brand him a traitor and a rebel, or might he be the one who can help us to cast off our colonial shackles and lead [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] towards freedom?"
 colonial_nation.4.a: "Promote him to general!"
 colonial_nation.4.b: "He must be executed!"
 colonial_nation.5.title: "Trouble in [from.GetName]"
 colonial_nation.5.desc: "A colonel in the [from.GetAdjective] army has been making a name for himself as a strong proponent of armed resistance against [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]! Besides being a gifted soldier, he seems to be an inspiring and charismatic leader, and more and more people seem to listen to his dangerous ideas of independence.\n\nBut instead of immediately beheading this upstart, the local authorities in [from.GetName] have promoted him to general!"
 colonial_nation.5.a: "How dare they?!"
 colonial_nation.6.title: "Colonial Rebel Executed"
 colonial_nation.6.desc: "A colonel in the [from.GetAdjective] army has been making a name for himself as a strong proponent of armed resistance against [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]! Besides being a gifted soldier, he seems to be an inspiring and charismatic leader, and more and more people seem to listen to his dangerous ideas of independence.\n\nFortunately, [from.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] [from.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] dealt with the matter swiftly by removing the colonel's head. This action, however, seems to have stirred up an even greater desire for liberty [from.GetName]..."
 colonial_nation.6.a: "Perhaps this was a rash solution..."
 colonial_nation.14.title: "The Burden of War"
 colonial_nation.14.desc: "Our recent war has left the country exhausted. Perhaps some of this burden should be shared by our colonies?"

 colonial_nation.14.b: "We will shoulder the burden."
 colonial_nation.15.title: "The Burden of War"
 colonial_nation.15.desc: "The recent war of [from.GetName] has left our country exhausted. Since the war involved one of our neighbors, [from.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] [from.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] has now decided that we should shoulder part of the burden!"
 colonial_nation.15.a: "Intolerable!"
 colonial_nation.182.title: "A Corrupted Governor"
 colonial_nation.182.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName]'s struggles with the administration of our nation are not a secret, and our most skilled diplomats have needed to silence rumors about [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerHis] ineptitude in an attempt to maintain the peace in the colony. However, the recent increase in corruption has brought about the inevitable. One of our former administrators has made public that the monetary help received by the Crown has gone directly into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName]'s pocket.\n\nThis disreputable behavior in times of need has led to a number of uprisings among our people that need to be taken care of."
 colonial_nation.182.a: "This is outrageous."
 colonial_nation.183.title: "A New Governor"
 colonial_nation.183.desc: "Rumors of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName]'s inefficient rule have unavoidably reached the Crown, spreading concerns about how this unfortunate situation may affect their reputation and ours. Under the threat of being assimilated by the Crown, the colony has offered us a palliative deal: Appoint a new governor who can take the reins of our colony before it is too late. "
 colonial_nation.183.a: "We should take their advice."
 colonial_nation.183.b: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] can still rule."

 colonial_nation.184.desc: "The trying times that are facing our colony know no apparent end. The monetary debt that is now laid upon us has crushed the spirit of our people who, prompted by the famine that their families are suffering, have demanded that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] find an immediate and effective solution."
 colonial_nation.184.a: "We shall use our influence to resolve this."
 colonial_nation.184.b: "Their complaints are baseless."
 colonial_nation.186.title: "Colonial Incentives"
 colonial_nation.186.desc: "The lands of our colony are fertile and excellent for farming, our people are kind and welcoming, our administration is as effective as it can be, and the wind sings of calm and stability, which is a far cry from the metropolis's political turmoil. We are indeed a paradise on earth, but change is often a displeasing, although sometimes necessary, process, and our population is not as high as we would like it to be.\n\nOne advisor has suggested that a new policy be enacted, increasing our tolerance of other faiths so that more colonists can be attracted to our prosperous land."
 colonial_nation.186.a: "This will surely grant us more settlers."
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_colonist_incentives: "Colonial Incentives"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_colonist_incentives: "A new set of privileges has been granted to all faiths."

 colonial_nation.187.desc: "Concerns have been raised among the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] regarding the rule of our colony. Their opinions had been hinted at and surreptitiously spread over the course of the past few months, but it has now become clear in many respects that their discontent is distinct and worrying.\n\nOne of their members approached [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] this morning, even before [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetSheHe] could attend the council, and has made their intentions quite explicit, saying 'We are deeply concerned about the noble oligarchy influencing [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s fate with their Old World's vices and greed.'"

 colonial_nation.187.b: "We need to protect the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')]."
 colonial_nation.188.title: "A Noble Concern"
 colonial_nation.188.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] are not very good at hiding their political positions, nor do they seem to care. They have been heard in feasts and banquets loudly stating that the colony is doomed to failure, due to the power that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] so wrongly hold.\n\nToday, however, their intentions have led to an unprecedented approach: One of them came to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName]'s chambers before the first hours of dawn. 'Sorry to interrupt your rest, my [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle],' they said, 'however something must be done immediately. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')]'s insolence and lack of virtue are making a fool's paradise of this colony. This must be stopped before today's council.'"
