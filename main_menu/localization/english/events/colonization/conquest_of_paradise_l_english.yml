 conquest_of_paradise.1.title: "Wage Laws for Builders"
 conquest_of_paradise.1.desc: "The cost of construction is going up because skilled labor is in short supply, as the new colonists flowing into the territory greatly demand their services. A proposal has been put forth that a maximum wage should be set across [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] for all carpenters, sawyers, masons and bricklayers. Their wages will be restricted to fair levels, while anyone demanding higher payment or offering to pay more for construction work would be subject to a penalty. How do we vote?"
 conquest_of_paradise.1.a: "Vote yes. It is a sound idea."
 conquest_of_paradise.1.b: "We do not need to regulate that."
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_construction_wages: "Construction Wages"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_construction_wages: "To keep escalating prices down, a maximum wage for construction labor has been put into place."
 conquest_of_paradise.2.title: "Colonial Border Conflict"
 conquest_of_paradise.2.desc: "Settlers from [colonial_conflict_target.GetLongName]'s colonies have breached our borders! In their search for resources, they have expanded into land that is part of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and come into conflict with the local population. This cannot be tolerated!"
 conquest_of_paradise.2.a: "Send the local militia to drive them out!"
 conquest_of_paradise.2.a.tt: "They may retaliate though..."
 conquest_of_paradise.2.b: "Let the situation resolve itself."
 conquest_of_paradise.3.title: "Colonial Border Conflict"
 conquest_of_paradise.3.desc: "In search of new land and resources, settlers from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have ventured across the border into [colonial_conflict_source.GetName], which has caused conflicts with the local population there. [colonial_conflict_source.GetLongName] then sent their militia to drive them out, but their militia seems to have gone too far, as their mission degenerated into a vengeful raid into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. This cannot be tolerated!"
 conquest_of_paradise.3.a: "Send in our local militia as well!"
 conquest_of_paradise.3.b: "Let the situation resolve itself."
 conquest_of_paradise.4.title: "Colonial Border Conflict"
 conquest_of_paradise.4.desc: "Sending our militia to drive out the competing settlers from [colonial_conflict_target.GetLongName] might have been a mistake. Encouraged by their easy success, our troops got carried away and continued into foreign lands, raiding the border villages there. This has greatly upset the locals and they have in turn sent their militia into our lands."
 conquest_of_paradise.4.a: "Damn them!"
 conquest_of_paradise.5.title: "Colonial Border Conflict"
 conquest_of_paradise.5.desc: "Sigh... Where to begin? It seems that settlers from [colonial_conflict_target.GetLongName] have ventured into [colonial_conflict_source.GetLongName] in search of new land and resources. [colonial_conflict_source.GetName] then sent their militia to drive them out, but they got overzealous and pursued the settlers back into [colonial_conflict_target.GetName], raiding and burning the settlements there. The conflict then escalated when [colonial_conflict_target.GetName] sent their militia to drive out the [colonial_conflict_source.GetAdjective] militia and carry out raids of their own into [colonial_conflict_target.GetName].\n\nThe [colonial_conflict_source.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] of [colonial_conflict_source.GetName], is blaming the [colonial_conflict_target.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] of [colonial_conflict_target.GetName], and vice versa. How do we resolve this conflict without losing face?"
 conquest_of_paradise.5.a: "Let the colonies sort it out themselves."
 conquest_of_paradise.5.b: "Reprimand those that escalated the conflict!"
 conquest_of_paradise.5.c: "Reprimand those that started the conflict!"

 conquest_of_paradise.10.title: "Enhanced Colonial Militia"
 conquest_of_paradise.10.desc: "The assembly has proposed that we set aside substantial resources to enhance our militia. The colony needs better protection from both native attacks and raids from other colonies. This will also strengthen us if we at some point should find ourselves at war with [ROOT.GetOverlord.GetName]."

 conquest_of_paradise.11.desc: "The people in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are too friendly with the Natives. A proposal has been put forward to ban all private trading with Natives, which would include the death penalty for anyone who is caught teaching a Native how to fire a gun. These new restrictions will injure the local economies of both the Natives and our subjects, but will ensure our security from armed Native raids."
 conquest_of_paradise.11.a: "Approve the proposal."

 conquest_of_paradise.11.b: "Ignore the issue."
 conquest_of_paradise.12.title: "The Harvest of [GetCurrentYear]"
 conquest_of_paradise.12.desc: "The crop harvest in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has been very poor this year and the shortage of food is already being felt across the colony. Food prices are soaring and some further predict that a harsh winter might be coming. The nearby Natives found out about our difficult situation and have volunteered some of their food supplies. What they brought is not nearly enough to sustain us through the winter, but there must be more corn where the gift came from. Some propose that we send soldiers to the Native villages and seize their food."
 conquest_of_paradise.12.a: "Take what we need."
 conquest_of_paradise.12.b: "We will solve this ourselves."
 conquest_of_paradise.13.title: "Iron Discovered"
 conquest_of_paradise.13.desc: "To sustain ourselves, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] must seek new sources of revenue and reduce our dependence on imports. A great opportunity has presented itself, though, as bog iron ore has been discovered in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]! There is now a proposition to mandate that the owner of the land construct a furnace and a forge and immediately begin production. In exchange, the owner will be guaranteed a 10-year-long tax break to subsidize the initial cost."
 conquest_of_paradise.13.a: "This sounds like a good opportunity."
 conquest_of_paradise.13.b: "No, thank you."
 conquest_of_paradise.14.title: "Domestic Wool Industry"
 conquest_of_paradise.14.desc: "The dwindling profits of colonial trade and our reliance on imported goods are starting to hurt [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. We must seek economic independence from imports, and to that end a new proposal has been presented: By outlawing the exporting of sheep and ordering more wool to be produced locally, we will ensure that enough warm clothes are being offered to the colonists. For this to work, a Textile Manufactory should be established in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 conquest_of_paradise.14.a: "This sounds like a good opportunity."
 conquest_of_paradise.14.b: "No, thank you."
 conquest_of_paradise.15.title: "Cash Crop Ban"
 conquest_of_paradise.15.desc: "Unlike the founders of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], new settlers tend to be short-sighted and put profits ahead of securing a future for themselves and their families. Many are ignoring the necessity of producing food for the colony and instead farm cash crops exclusively, believing that they will be able to sell their crops and purchase food from other farmers. If this continues, our colony will eventually face famine and disorder. To prevent such an eventuality, some have suggested a law which would require that new farmers produce food in at least a part of their fields."
 conquest_of_paradise.15.a: "A law seems necessary."
 conquest_of_paradise.15.b: "This is none of our business."
 conquest_of_paradise.16.title: "Banned Tobacco Planting"
 conquest_of_paradise.16.desc: "When we first arrived here, the prices of Tobacco were soaring, and the profits were immense. Now, as more farmers arrive and start their own plantations, the supply of Tobacco is rising quickly and causing the prices in Europe to drop year after year. Established planters have set forth a proposal to ban the planting of Tobacco for one year, so that prices have time to recover. New farmers are obviously opposed to this proposal, but we must do what is necessary to protect our livelihoods."
 conquest_of_paradise.16.a: "Enforce this ban."
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_banned_tobacco_planting: "Banned Tobacco Planting"
 conquest_of_paradise.16.b: "Reject their proposal."
