While there are many important self-governed cities in the Empire, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetNameWithNoTooltip] now has something beyond its wealth and size to protect it - economic and political freedoms perpetually guaranteed by the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetLeaderTitle] [target_ruler.GetHerselfHimself]."

 free_cities.3.desc: "The discontent and animosity between the lower classes and the rulers of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] have brought us to the brink of civil war. [home_ruler.GetName] is ill-prepared to face a full-fledged rebellion, and many members of the upper classes are urging the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetRank.GetNameWithNoTooltip] council to take the matter to [hre_ruler.GetName], to beg [hre_ruler.GetHimHerFormal] for any help [hre_ruler.GetSheHe] is able to provide. Good strong men and gold are what we need most to end the fires of rebellion that smolder the streets of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."

 free_cities.4.title: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('riots_source').GetLongNameWithNoTooltip] Begs for Our Help"
 free_cities.4.desc: "We received an envoy this morning from the [SCOPE.sCountry('riots_source').GetLongName] detailing the city council's utter failure to satiate the needs of their working classes. The messenger spoke of fires smoldering and raging in the streets of [SCOPE.sCountry('riots_source').GetCapital.GetName] as a metaphor for the discontent that the [ShowSpecialStatusName('free_city')] struggles with, and claims that if nothing is done then the city's peasants will soon raise their pitchforks in rebellion. They humbly plead for soldiers and gold, so that they may be able to bring swift justice to those discontent citizens."
 free_cities.4.a: "It's a reasonable request, and one we will honor."
 free_cities.4.b: "The problem is deep within themselves, we will not send help."
 free_cities.5.title: "The [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetLeaderTitle]'s Response"
 free_cities.5.desc: "For every day the discontent grows and no matter how we try to use the men we have at our disposal, once one fire is quenched another smolders into flames before our eyes. Where is that messenger? We hope our humble request to [SCOPE.sCountry('hre_leader').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] will not anger [SCOPE.sCountry('hre_leader').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHimHerFormal], and that [SCOPE.sCountry('hre_leader').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetSheHe] will agree to help us."

 free_cities.6.desc: "[pope_ruler.GetName] placed the Imperial Regalia in the hands of the new [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetLeaderTitle] of the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetName], a symbol of the [GetCountry('PAP').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s right to crown [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('christian')] sovereigns and the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetLeaderTitle]'s role as protector of the Roman Catholic Church. It was a great honor for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] to be selected as the location for the coronation, and the church of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetNameWithNoTooltip] could barely hold all the dignities that had gathered to see the new [target_ruler.GetName] crowned."
 free_cities.6.a: "We are blessed indeed!"
 free_cities.7.title: "The Treaty Conference"
 free_cities.7.desc: "After the Peace Conference held in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was over, the diplomats from both the victors in [SCOPE.sCountry('winner').GetName] and the diplomats signing the surrender conditions of [SCOPE.sCountry('loser').GetName] thanked us for our help in assisting them with all the necessary details which surrounds such an important event, and for our neutrality in this matter. This helped them focus on the task at hand. Though we were not monetarily compensated for anything more than the expenses made for the conference, we are now considered a more prestigious country than before."
 free_cities.7.a: "Worth all the hassle, then."
 free_cities.8.title: "Custom and Tax Privileges"
 free_cities.8.desc: "The [ShowSpecialStatusName('free_city')] of [SCOPE.sCountry('free_city_in_debt_target').GetName] is struggling under its own weight, barely making enough money to keep itself away from the dreaded hole that is bankruptcy. Once the economy of [SCOPE.sCountry('free_city_in_debt_target').GetNameWithNoTooltip] inevitably crumbles under the weight of the issues they created themselves, it will be damaging not only to their reputation, but also to the reputation and legitimacy of the Empire itself. We could try helping them by granting them some custom and tax privileges that, if handled correctly, will alleviate their financial difficulties."

 free_cities.9.a: "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!"
 free_cities.10.title: "Wellborns with Weapons"
 free_cities.10.desc: "Land-owning nobles in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] dislike that our [ShowSpecialStatusName('free_city')] status keeps us out of direct noble rule, and lately we have exhausted every option in keeping them quiet. Had they been mere peasants, armed with pitchforks and torches and with little military training, we would be able to squash any revolt they may spark. But these are men and women with land and titles and formally trained in the art of war, and should not be underestimated. The only one that may silence their ambitions is [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetLeaderCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName]..."
 free_cities.10.a: "Ask the Emperor for help."
 free_cities.10.b: "Give the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] some privileges and hope they shut up."

 free_cities.11.desc: "It has come to our attention that the [SCOPE.sCountry('free_city_source').GetLongName] is struggling with land-owning [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] that dislike [SCOPE.sCountry('free_city_source').GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s status as a [ShowSpecialStatusName('free_city')]. The country asks for our help to rebuke the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] and make them accept [SCOPE.sCountry('free_city_source').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName]'s secular leadership, free from royal titles and privileges."
 free_cities.11.a: "They will have our help."

So far, they have had little success with this but we fear, as we always do when some uppity princes with fancy surnames are trying to shatter the peace we fight so hard to keep. What will [home_ruler.GetName] think of us? Will [home_ruler.GetHeSheFormal] keep [home_ruler.GetHisHer] promise and end this unruly [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')]?"

 free_cities.13.title: "City League"
 free_cities.13.desc: "The Hanseatic League and the Lombard League have inspired us to inquire if any other Free Cities would be willing to enter a league together with us. We Free Cities are weak alone, but collectively it has already been proven that mutual cooperation between small nations in matters such as trade, keeping imperial peace, and supporting tribunals and maintaining a unified force makes us a force to be reckoned with that even Great Powers will struggle to suppress."
 free_cities.13.a: "Send diplomats to [SCOPE.sCountry('fc_league_invitation_target').GetName]!"
 free_cities.13.b: "Couldn't we just hire mercenaries instead?"
 free_cities.14.title: "The City League Suggestion"
 free_cities.14.desc: "There have been many Leagues of mutual cooperation within the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetName]. The Hanseatic League, for example, was a league of merchant guilds in a commercial and defensive confederation, or the Swabian League which was a mutual defense and peacekeeping association. Some Leagues become so powerful and united that they are even viewed as a state in themselves, like the Swiss League. The [ShowSpecialStatusName('free_city')] of [SCOPE.sCountry('fc_league_invitation_source').GetName] has suggested that we join something similar, a cooperation of sorts, where we collaborate in matters of trade, keeping imperial peace, and supporting tribunals."

 free_cities.17.title: "The City League Membership"
 free_cities.17.desc: "The cooperation between various Free Cities, based on and inspired by leagues such as the Swabian League, the Hanseatic League and the Lombard League, seems to be working splendidly. They have agreed to work together on matters of trade, keeping imperial peace and supporting tribunals. We, as a [ShowSpecialStatusName('free_city')], could ask for membership in this rather exclusive union..."

 free_cities.19.desc: "Many scholars and learned men call the Free City of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] their home.
