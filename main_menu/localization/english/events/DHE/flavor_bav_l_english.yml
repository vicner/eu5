The 14th and 15th centuries saw multiple such partitions, including the notorious division of 1392 which gave rise to the separate duchies of Bavaria-Munich, Bavaria-Ingolstadt, and Bavaria-Landshut. Efforts to preserve unity were frequently undermined by noble interests and inheritance traditions, which favored partition among heirs over primogeniture."

In recognition of this unwavering loyalty and to strengthen the Catholic position within the Empire, Ferdinand II convened the Diet of Regensburg in 1623. There, he officially transferred the electoral dignity from the Protestant Elector Palatine, Frederick V—who had been placed under the imperial ban for his role in the Bohemian Revolt—to Maximilian I.
