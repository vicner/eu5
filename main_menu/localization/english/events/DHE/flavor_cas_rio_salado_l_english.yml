 flavor_cas_rio_salado.1.historical_info: "The situation in the southern border of Castile looked grim in the decade of 1330. The loss of the castle of Gibraltar in 1333 opened an opportunity to Abu Malik Abd al-Wahid, son and heir of Abu Al-Hasan 'Ali ibn 'Othman, Marinid Sultan of Morocco, to seize a petty kingdom centered around Algeciras and Ronda. The death of the former in an #italic algarada#! (raid) in 1339 convinced the latter to prepare a full invasion across the Strait of Gibraltar, which could be financed by his conquest of the Emirate of Tlemcen in 1337. The campaign started in April of 1340, when the Marinid fleet achieved naval supremacy over the strait, allowing Abu Al-Hasan 'Ali to cross with an army in 14 August 1340, and later in September starting a siege over the castle of Tarifa, the key Castilian fortress in the area.\n\nFinally, the Muslim and Christian forces faced each other at the valley of Río Salado on the 30th of October. The confronting armies fought the entire day, and after the defenders of Tarifa attacked from the rearguard, the Marinid army collapsed, and Sultan Abu Al-Hasan 'Ali retired with the remnants of his army to Algeciras. The battle resulted in a turning point, as it secured the Castilian position over the Strait for 150 years, until the last Muslim stronghold in the Iberian Peninsula, Granada, was conquered in 1492."
