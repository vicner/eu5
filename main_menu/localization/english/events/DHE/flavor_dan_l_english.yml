 flavor_dan.1.a: "This has to be divine punishment!"
 flavor_dan.1.historical_info: "The Burchardi storm tide occurred in October 1634 and devastated the North Sea coastline of Denmark and Schleswig. Due to the ongoing conflict in the Holy Roman Empire between Protestants and Catholics at that time, the dikes protecting the north Frisian coastline fell in disrepair and were not able to provide protection against the incoming waves. The flood caused approximately between 8000 and 15000 deaths and had severe long-term consequences for the area, causing the abandoning of farmland and the eradication of the Old Nordstrand variety of the North Frisian language"

Since their interests rarely align, we should focus on creating a Constitution for our union, which forces the [ShowEstateType('nobles_estate')] to cooperate if no consensus can be reached.
