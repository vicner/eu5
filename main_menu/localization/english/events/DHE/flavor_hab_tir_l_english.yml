Especially the [GetDynasty('wittelsbach_dynasty').GetName] and [GetDynasty('habsburg_dynasty').GetName] have an interest in securing our lands and could serve as great allies... or be the downfall of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."

Their mutual dislike of each other has been known for multiple years now, but by now it has evolved beyond a simple dislike into open hatred. [target_spouse.GetNameWithNoTooltip] has displayed an open desire to act as the official ruler of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. It seems more and more likely that their marriage will remain childless, which could pose a significant threat to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. However, it is unlikely that we would receive papal consent for a divorce due to the political situation the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetName] is currently in.\n\nWith the support of [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetLeaderCountry.GetName] we could force a divorce, but we would fall further into their own sphere of interest."

Frustrated, [target_spouse.GetHeShe] had to move on to find shelter in another castle. To his surprise, every castle in [GetCountry('TIR').GetNameWithNoTooltip] denied [target_spouse.GetHimHer] entry, forcing [target_spouse.GetHimHer] to leave the county and return to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], after briefly being sheltered in northern [ShowRegionName('italy_region')]. Shortly after [target_spouse.GetHisHer] own arrival in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle], we received news from [GetCountry('TIR').GetNameWithNoTooltip] that [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] has divorced [target_spouse.GetHimHer] with the approval of the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetLeaderTitle]."
