While the [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('university')] has already earned the approval of [pap_ruler.GetName], with the sanctioning of a golden bull, many on the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] still worry that the ambition to model the [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('university')] after that of the one in [ShowLocationName('paris')] may prove too costly. Should the project continue however, the [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('university')] has the potential to become one to rival many of the other [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('university')] through [ShowRegionName('great_britain_region')]."

However, should news of an expansion of the navy reach [GetCountry('ENG').GetNameWithNoTooltip], the [GetCountry('ENG').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] may feel the need to take action."

While some on the council have proposed that a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] still be convened even for small matters, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('crown_estate')] no longer relying on its advice has enabled it to grow in power."
