For that, [target_ruler.GetSheHe] intends to have land acquired for the purpose of creating a park. The intended land, however, is owned by the city dwellers."
 flavor_mlo.42.historical_info: "The Visconti Park was a tract of land acquired by the Visconti Lord of Milan to enhance the splendor of their estate in Pavia. To acquire the land for the hunting grounds, Galeazzo II Visconti had to seize territories from the local city dwellers, causing wide unrest. One of the citizens that got their lands confiscated was Bertolino de' Sisti, whose lost income led him to have an attempt on Galeazzo's life."

 flavor_mlo.48.historical_info: "The expansion of the Della Scala in the early 14th century spurred a coalition to form against them. The conflict against this 'Anti-scaligeri' league was sparked by the Veronese moves against the Republic of Venice in 1336.
