 flavor_kie.1.title: "[ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('kyiv')] Academy of Culture"
 flavor_kie.1.desc: "In order to preserve the pillars of the [ShowCultureName('ruthenian')] history and traditions, [target_ruler.GetName] has proposed to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] of [ShowLocationName('kyiv')] to offer a sponsorship for a new [ShowBuildingTypeName('university')] in the [target_location.GetRank.GetName]. The [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('kyiv')] Bratstvo is planned to host this center of learning, opening the door for many citizens within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and abroad to be taught of the history of the [target_location.GetRank.GetNameWithNoTooltip].\n\nThis is sure to strengthen [ShowRegionName('ruthenia_region')], but at the same time, it would be a costly endeavor. Perhaps [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] should let such a [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('university')] be constructed over time, without any patronage from the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('crown_estate')]."
 flavor_kie.1.historical_info: "Founded in 1615 by the Kyiv Brotherhood, the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy served as one of the few theological schools of Orthodox Christians within Ruthenia. Although it was not originally recognized as such, the treaty of Hadiach in 1658 elevated it to its university status. After the conquest of the city by Russia, Peter 'the Great' decided not only to retain it, but also allowed students ranging from Saint Petersburg to Greece to attend classes there. It was not until 1817 when it was closed, and in 1834 when Tsar Nicholas I created a new university in its place, the Saint Vladimir University."
 flavor_kie.1.a: "Our coffers are always ready for the progress of [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('kyiv')]."
 flavor_kie.1.b: "They do not have our permission to construct it."
 flavor_kie.1.c: "We shall use all of our coffers to help them."
 flavor_kie.1.d: "They can build it, only if we do not pay for it."

 flavor_kie.2.title: "Future of the Kholop Class"
 flavor_kie.2.desc: "The Kholop class has always been treated no better than [ShowPopTypeName('slaves')], leaving too much of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] in [ShowRegionName('ruthenia_region')] to suffer mistreatment from the higher classes, such as the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')]. There has been a sentiment growing within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] wishing to abolish this exploitation that has been harming the corvée economy. This will not sit well within the powerful [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')], but it is certain to increase the popular opinion of [target_character.GetName]."
 flavor_kie.2.historical_info: "Kholops had been the backbone of the Ruthenian economy since the 11th century. Being close to a slave, an owner of one had unlimited power over them, but also was responsible for their actions. Within Kyiv, they represented the majority of the low class, until the 15th century when more rights were given to them, becoming closer to that of European serfs."
 flavor_kie.2.a: "If it is better treatment they want, then we will guarantee them that."
 flavor_kie.2.b: "We are not here to seek the wrath of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')]."
 flavor_kie.2.c: "These serfs demand too much, let us be harsher to them!"
 flavor_kie.2.d: "This reform will be our biggest priority."

 flavor_kie.3.title: "[target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_kie.3.desc_common: "With the need to gain influence over [target_location.GetName], our nation has been searching for a new Metropolitan to rule over the [target_location.GetRank.GetName]. One of these individuals that would fit as a candidate is [target_character.GetName], a native of the people there."
 flavor_kie.3.desc_RUS: "$flavor_kie.3.desc_common$ Many within the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] think that such a [target_character.GetWomanMan] will be detrimental to our effort to strengthen our influence over the [target_location.GetRank.GetNameWithNoTooltip] of [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip]. It is why there has been a demand to put [target_character.GetHerHim] in charge of the Metropolitan there."
 flavor_kie.3.desc_ZAZ: "$flavor_kie.3.desc_common$ Being in favor with [target_character2.GetName], many think that such a [target_character.GetWomanMan] would make a great Metropolitan, a loyal subject that will allow us to better control [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip] and better develop its streets."
 flavor_kie.3.desc: "$flavor_kie.3.desc_common$ The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] thinks that such a figure will also be great for our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCabinetTitle], although it might be costly to maintain [target_character.GetHerHis] position in both places."
 flavor_kie.3.a: "Let us hire [target_character.GetHerHim]."
 flavor_kie.3.b: "We have no need of a new Metropolitan."
 flavor_kie.3.c: "Having the favor of both [target_character2.GetNameWithNoTooltip] and [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip] is a great benefit."
 flavor_kie.3.d: "[target_character.GetSheHe|U] will help us undermine the influence of [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."

 flavor_kie.4.title: "[target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_kie.4.desc: "With [target_location.GetName] turning into a cultural center for all [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people to witness, it has also given the rise to many artists. One of them is [target_character.GetName], a renowned [ShowArtistTypeName('iconographer')] within the [ShowReligionName('orthodox')] community of the [target_location.GetRank.GetName]. Wishing to stray away from the traditional iconographic canons and develop [target_character.GetHerHis] new style, [target_character.GetSheHe] now wishes to be employed in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle], potentially to gain our favor so that [target_character.GetSheHe] can create [target_character.GetHerHis] own art institution within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip], as well as help spread the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCulture.GetName] culture across [ShowContinentName('europe')]."
 flavor_kie.4.a: "We accept all kinds of art, even those that do not fit [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] perfectly."
 flavor_kie.4.b: "[target_character.GetSheHe|U] shall have [target_character.GetHerHis] institution."
 flavor_kie.4.c: "[target_character.GetSheHe|U] is not allowed in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."

 flavor_kie.5.title: "$st_andrew_church$"
 flavor_kie.5.desc: "As the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are proud of their [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] ways, there has been a request from the citizens residing within the [target_location.GetRank.GetName] of [target_location.GetName] that we construct a new church for them to pray to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName]. This idea has intrigued [target_character2.GetName], who would like to set up a new residence there. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] as well are in support of it, and are recommending that we hire [target_character.GetName], a renowned [target_character.GetArtistType.GetName] to help us design such monument.\n\nMeant to be dedicated to Saint Andrew, the Apostle of Rus', it will also gain us favors with the Patriarch, and show our devotion to other [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] nations."
 flavor_kie.5.a: "We shall aid with the construction of this new church."
 flavor_kie.5.b: "A project like that would be too costly."

 flavor_kie.6.title: "Metropolis of All Rus'"
 flavor_kie.6.desc: "The growth of [target_location.GetName] has attracted many people of the [ShowReligionAdjective('orthodox')] and [ShowReligionAdjective('catholic')] faiths. Although they both believe in the same [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGodName], religious doctrines have never allowed them to properly co-exist, usually clashing over their beliefs of the Holy Trinity. [target_character.GetName] wishes to undo this, instead empowering the [ShowCultureName('ruthenian')] [ShowReligionNameWithNoTooltip('orthodox')] Church, straying it away from that of the [ShowCultureGroupName('russian_group')] ways."
 flavor_kie.6.a: "Let us strengthen the [target_location.GetRank.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 flavor_kie.6.b: "We should just let this be a religious matter instead."

 flavor_kie.7.title: "Trouble in [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('kyiv')]"
 flavor_kie.7.desc: "Recent investigations in the [target_location.GetRank.GetName] of [target_location.GetName] have shown that the Metropolitan assigned by the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('crown_estate')] has fallen out of favor with the local populace there. Reason being the rights we have revoked from them, treating it as we have been intolerant to their [ShowReligionName('orthodox')] ways. They now wish to instead separate from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and look to join any [ShowReligionNameWithNoTooltip('orthodox')] realm that will protect their rights."
 flavor_kie.7.a: "We shall maintain our stance in [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 flavor_kie.7.b: "Perhaps it is time we loosen our control over the Metropolitan."
 kie_all_kiev_pops_become_angrier_tt: "All [ShowReligionAdjective('orthodox')] [pops|e] in [target_location.GetName] will lose [ShowNamedValue('pop_satisfaction_ultimate_penalty')|+=2%] [pop_satisfaction|e]"

 flavor_kie.8.title: "A New Metropolitan for [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('kyiv')]"
 flavor_kie.8.desc: "[ShowRegionName('ruthenia_region')] has long lacked a Metropolitan to guide its people. Seeking to remedy this, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] have appealed to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('crown_estate')] to appoint one from among their own. They argue that this is the only way to ensure the region is properly administered without interference from the state. We could grant them this authority, though it would risk increasing their influence in [target_location.GetName]."
 flavor_kie.8.a: "If they demand, we shall deliver."
 flavor_kie.8.b: "We will not allow them to control the [target_location.GetRank.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."

 flavor_kie.9.desc: "Within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], a number of lesser-known artists have been striving to develop a new artistic style inspired by the aesthetics of antiquity. Among them is [target_character.GetName], a mute from [ShowLocationName('hlukhiv')] who has studied and produced several notable works.
