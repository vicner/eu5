 flavor_kbo.2.title: "Founding of [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_kbo.2.desc: "While [ShowAreaName('bornu_area')] is a rich area fully worthy to be the capital of our kingdom, defending it has always been a problem. From the east, our old enemies the [target_country.GetName] frequently raid our lands, and frequent succession wars also highlight the need for a more fortified capital.\n\nPlans have been drawn up for the creation of a fortified city past the western shore of Lake Chad in [target_location.GetName] to ensure the future safety of our dynasty."

 flavor_kbo.3.title: "Enforcing Islamic Orthodoxy"
 flavor_kbo.3.desc: "While our Islamic [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] is one of the oldest in this region, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetName] is even among the upper classes an unorthodox and syncretic religion. Inspired by the many learned men who come to our capital, we have been considering conducting a purge of the religious syncretism, especially among the aristocracy and the members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetDynasty.GetName] dynasty. As its more conflicting lines get some of their support from heathens, we can only hope that this will perhaps also lessen the political instability of our country."

 flavor_kbo.3.b: "Let us not go overboard with this."

 flavor_kbo.7.title: "Thorns of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective|U] Crown"
 flavor_kbo.7.desc: "Despite our dominance over our foes, past and present, there are many within our nation who wish to see our great palaces burn and our people perish. Be wary of the jackals amongst us, for they will strike at a moment of weakness, ready to tear apart what we have built. We must seek wise counsel and determine a steady course of action, lest we risk falling pray to these power-hungry vultures."

 flavor_kbo.8.desc: "Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]s lead their troops from the front, a tradition which is deeply rooted in our culture and traditions. This courageous practice showcases our unwavering commitment and inspires our soldiers to fight with utmost bravery. However, doing so exposes our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] to immense dangers, placing their lives directly on the line amidst the chaos of battle.\n\nDespite the risks involved, this leadership style is a cherished part of the people's heritage, symbolizing our embodiment of honor, valor, and sacrifice for the greater good of our folk. It serves as a powerful testament to our unyielding dedication to protect and lead the people."
 flavor_kbo.8.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] will cower from no enemy!"

 flavor_kbo.9.desc: "Merchants from far away, carrying ornate objects and exotic goods, have occasionally made their way into our market. Despite our settlements north into the desert, we have hardly paid any attention to funneling more diverse trade through these corridors. Perhaps it would be wise to shift our mercantile efforts and use the sandy paths that lead to contact with the [ShowRegionName('maghreb_region')]."
 flavor_kbo.9.a: "Open trade with the Northerners is the way to go."

 flavor_kbo.10.desc: "Our great nation was one of the earliest countries in our region to embrace [ShowReligionName('sunni')] and integrate its many facets into every aspect of our society. Despite dissenting voices during that time, the transition has come to greatly benefit our people in the long term, establishing relations with foreign like-minded rulers and opening up lucrative trade opportunities.\n\nOnce again, the time has come to delegate our priorities in embracing the aspects of legalism and choose whether or not we wish to integrate them into our current society."
 flavor_kbo.10.a: "We would be wise to cultivate this institution."
 flavor_kbo.10.b: "Let us not interact with the current status quo..."

 flavor_kbo.11.title: "Relocation of the [target_pop.GetCulture.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_kbo.11.desc: "Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] is built upon the previous achievements of the Duguwa dynasty, members of the [target_pop.GetCulture.GetName]. Their kingdom wasn't strong enough and it quickly crumbled under our [ShowCultureName('kanembu_culture')] ancestors coming from the north. They then replaced the Duguwa and established our current [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank].\n\nHowever, many of the [target_pop.GetCulture.GetNameWithNoTooltip] live still within our borders, and for some that would question our legitimacy as rulers. It would be wise if we remove this problem before it becomes too big of a risk."

 flavor_kbo.11.b: "Let them be."

 flavor_kbo.12.title: "Legacy of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_kbo.12.desc: "The recent times have really taken a toll on our glorious people. The constant conflicts with the [ShowCultureName('bilala_culture')] and the [ShowCultureName('sao_culture')] have eroded our country like a pest. The last nail in the coffin was the loss of the province of [target_lost_province.GetName], once an integral part of our territory and identity, which now lies unquestionably beyond our reach. Do we really have the right to keep calling ourselves the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip] if we do not control [target_lost_province.GetName]?"
 flavor_kbo.12.bad.desc: "Dark times are upon us. The recent crises have taken a toll on the previously glorious [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName], and we have not emerged from them unscathed. Some may say that we are but a shell of our former selves, and seeing the recent losses of [ShowProvinceDefinitionName('kanem_province')] and [ShowProvinceDefinitionName('bornu_province')], once an integral part of our territory and identity, those voices may be right. Are we doomed to disappear into obscurity or will we manage to rise from our ashes?"

 flavor_kbo.15.title: "The Slave Trade in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_kbo.15.desc: "As it happens in various parts of the continent, so too our economy depends largely on the influx and utility of forced labor. The frequent raids propped up by our army and local warlords supply our markets with fresh manpower to serve in every corner of our society. However, due to our recent advances and investment in these activities, we have accumulated a profound number of these people. Thus, it befalls on us to decide whether we wish to continue investing in these raids and magnify the flow of conquered people within or market or decide to grant them a position within our society and allow them to flourish as part of it."
 flavor_kbo.15.a: "Let us work to integrate all in our society."
 flavor_kbo.15.b: "Our economy will greatly benefit from this trade."

 flavor_kbo.16.desc: "For centuries, after the introduction of the camel in Western and Central Africa, many traders have taken it upon themselves to traverse the adverse environments in search of profits and mercantile adventures using routes such as the Azalai or Taghlamt. Known as the Amenokal, these powerful individuals would oversee and travel across the desert, from oasis to oasis, linking faraway locations and trading valuable [ShowGoodsName('salt')]. In these markets, salt would be sold in slabs or bricks in exchange for food, cattle, and other important commodities. Whether to give such a privileged overseeing position to powerful individuals or not is a delicate matter, and one that would require our most trusted advisors to handle."
 flavor_kbo.16.a: "Let the Amenokal of each caravan oversee their trade."
 flavor_kbo.16.b: "This authority is reserved for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName]!"

With a newfound vigor for true belief and armed with relentless energy, we have done our best to consolidate our religious values and defend our people from prying heathens. However, one aspect of our faith that has not taken hold just yet, is the $sharia$. A collection of religious laws that may dictate the efficiency of our administration, as well as the effect it may have on our people. Whilst many of our advisors are in favor of implementing the $sharia$, others caution against intertwining religion and administration."
