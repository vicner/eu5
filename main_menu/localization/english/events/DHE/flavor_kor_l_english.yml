 flavor_kor.31.desc: "The [ShowLawName('imperial_examination_law')] is in need of fresh students. In order to fulfill the recruitment quota for our government positions, let us create an institution in [target_location.GetName], our capital, for it to serve as a place where meritocracy can shine bright and the best of the best are selected."
 flavor_kor.31.a: "Establish the institution."
 flavor_kor.31.b: "We cannot spare the funds."

 flavor_kor.32.title: "A Dangerous Mutiny"
 flavor_kor.32.desc: "One of our generals, [target_character.GetName], greatly disappointed by the actions of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName], has decided to take reins into [target_character.GetHerHis] own hands and raised arms in a vicious mutiny against the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]! The [target_country.GetLongName] are now up in arms against us in [target_location.GetName]."
 flavor_kor.32.a: "Blasted traitors!"
 kor_mutiny: "[target_character.GetName] has started a mutiny in [target_country.GetName]."

 flavor_kor.33.title: "$tongguk_tonggam$"
 flavor_kor.33.desc: "The early history of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] remains shrouded in many mysteries, and facts will continue to slip from general knowledge unless something is done. To combat this, [target_character.GetName] has begun the process of compiling the early history of [ShowRegionName('korea_region')], but requires further funds to finish. The resulting [ShowWorkOfArtTypeName('chronicle')] would be entitled $tongguk_tonggam$."
 flavor_kor.33.a: "Support [target_character.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]."
 flavor_kor.33.b: "Focus on other matters."

 flavor_kor.34.title: "Disturbance of Three Ports"
 flavor_kor.34.desc: "We permit the [ShowCultureGroupName('japanese_group')] merchants to do limited amounts of trade in a few of the southern ports of [ShowRegionName('korea_region')], most notably the [target_location.GetRank.GetName] of [target_location.GetName]. Despite our benevolence, local visiting merchants remain ungrateful, and have taken up arms after their exclusion from our tax breaks. Thankfully, this bloody riot was put down by our military and we have restored control over the [target_location.GetRank.GetNameWithNoTooltip]. This is not enough for our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] however, who are calling for harsher measures to be taken against the rioters."
 flavor_kor.34.a: "Reduce trading privileges of the [ShowCultureGroupNameWithNoTooltip('japanese_group')]."
 flavor_kor.34.b: "Try to defuse the tensions."

 flavor_kor.35.title: "$kor_cloud_dream_of_nine$"
 flavor_kor.35.desc: "A [ShowWorkOfArtTypeName('novel')] entitled $kor_cloud_dream_of_nine$ has begun spreading around our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle]. Written in [ShowAdvanceName('kor_hangeul_alphabet')], it has become quite renowned amongst our scholarly. Its author is unknown, but is widely believed to be [target_character.GetName], who has since denied all attributions of authorship. Though it is believed to be a well written work of art, the act of writing a fantasy novel in the alphabet would not be considered too positively."
 flavor_kor.35.a: "It is truly wonderful!"
 flavor_kor.35.b: "Truly shameful! We cannot let such boundaries be broken."

 flavor_kor.36.title: "Bureau of Interpreters"
 flavor_kor.36.desc: "Despite all the cultural assimilation, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCulture.GetLanguage.GetName] language remains alien to all of our neighbors. With the lack of intelligibility, diplomacy with other states is rather difficult and all of missions to and fro must be accompanied by interpreters who can overcome those burdens. Such an important aspect this is, that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] has concluded that we need a professional institution for the training of interpreters to aid our diplomatic and tributary missions."
 flavor_kor.36.a: "Establish the [ShowModifierWithNoTooltip('kor_sayeogwon')]."
 flavor_kor.36.b: "We will do without them."

 flavor_kor.37.title: "A Critique of [ShowReligionGroupNameWithNoTooltip('buddhist')]"
 flavor_kor.37.desc: "One of our scholars associated with [target_international_organization.GetName] has recently produced a grand treatise outlining many different polemical arguments against the tenets of [ShowReligionGroupName('buddhist')]. The release of 'An Array of Critiques of Buddhism' marks a turning point, for we can now be certain that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] society is slowly turning towards the beliefs of [target_international_organization.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 flavor_kor.37.a: "Promote the treatises far and wide."
 flavor_kor.37.b: "Condemn the work."

 flavor_kor.38.title: "Strife of Princes"
 flavor_kor.38.desc: "The succession of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] is far from secure. Though [target_character2.GetName] remains nominally the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle], the tensions in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] do remain high. This is because many ministers believe [target_character.GetName] to have a higher ambition than the one of [target_character.GetHerHis] relative. Though no violence has yet erupted, the two are guaranteed to clash, providing nothing is done about it beforehand."
 flavor_kor.38.a: "Support [target_character.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]."
 flavor_kor.38.b: "Favor the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle], [target_character2.GetNameWithNoTooltip] instead."

 flavor_kor.39.title: "Serving the [GetInternationalOrganization('middle_kingdom').GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_kor.39.desc: "For much of the past centuries, the predecessors of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have lived and operated in submission to the states in $china$. This makes sense, as the resources held by [GetInternationalOrganization('middle_kingdom').GetName] are vast and outright hostility would only serve to hurt the interests of both parties. Such submission was mutually beneficial to both sides, but has also placed us in the humiliating position of a lesser party, drawing [ShowCultureName('korean_culture')] culture closer to the [ShowCultureGroupName('chinese_group')] rather than the contrary."
 flavor_kor.39.a: "Embrace the policy in its earnest."
 flavor_kor.39.b: "We shall no longer lie in the shadow of $china$."

 flavor_kor.40.title: "Forbidding Private Armies"
 flavor_kor.40.desc: "As it stands, the military men of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], predominantly members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')], are well within their right to own and manage private armies. This poses significant risk to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] and could lead to coups, civil wars, and other forms of disorder further down the line. Such state of affairs has been the focus of [ShowSocietyDirectionName('centralization')] policies which are spearheaded by the government of [target_character.GetName]. The [ShowEstatePrivilegeName('noble_armies')] must be curbed."
 flavor_kor.40.a: "Proceed with the restrictions."
 flavor_kor.40.b: "This must be halted."

 flavor_kor.41.title: "Pushback against [ShowAdvanceNameWithNoTooltip('kor_hangeul_alphabet')]"
 flavor_kor.41.desc: "The invention of [ShowAdvanceName('kor_hangeul_alphabet')] has been of great benefit to the commons of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] society. Unlike the foreign [ShowCultureGroupName('chinese_group')] script, known in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] as #italic Hanja#!, the alphabet is easy to learn, improving literacy rates across the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. This dissemination of such basic skills has not been without pushback though, for the elites, mostly members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')], have been pushing back against the new invention."
 flavor_kor.41.a: "Ignore the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')]."
 flavor_kor.41.b: "Appease the elites."

 flavor_kor.100.title: "[korRuler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s Northern Expedition"
 flavor_kor.100.desc: "[korRuler.GetName] plans to launch a northern expedition to chastise the [ShowCultureName('jurchen_culture')] people. This will require substantial preparations, funds, and is impossible to keep secret. [korRuler.GetSheHe|U] plans to strengthen Korea's defenses by increasing and improving training and upgrading our fortresses."
 flavor_kor.100.a: "Prepare for war."
 
 flavor_kor.101.title: "First Literati Purge"
 flavor_kor.101.desc: "While serving as Third Censor in [GetCurrentYear], the Neo-Confucian [target_character.GetName], a former state historian, has proven [target_character.GetHerselfHimself] to be a man willing to go to great lengths in criticizing government officials and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] elite. [target_character.GetHisHer|U] many opponents have uncovered certain allusions made in [target_character.GetHisHer] draft of the #italic Annals of King Seongjong#! which they insist to be treasonous. They demand [target_character.GetHisHer] immediate execution, and that his supporters among the Neo-Confucians be either banished or executed."
 flavor_kor.101.a: "Execute him!"
 flavor_kor.101.b: "Purge the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] instead!"
 flavor_kor.101.c: "We must maintain the political balance."

 flavor_kor.102.title: "Second Literati Purge"
 flavor_kor.102.desc: "During a state banquet, Minister of Rites [target_character.GetName] spilled wine on the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s robes. Coming as it does after a period of intense factional rivalry and criticism of royal authority, [target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s opponents have been quick to interpret the occurrence as a crime against the sovereign and therefore treasonous. They demand the purge of [target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip] and his many allies, who cut across factions. Indeed, this appears to present a golden opportunity to rid the government of those who would question royal authority."
 flavor_kor.102.a: "Purge all those who oppose us."
 flavor_kor.102.b: "We must maintain the political balance."

 flavor_kor.103.title: "Third Literati Purge"
 flavor_kor.103.desc: "[jo_gwang_jo.GetName], a Neo-Confucian reformer, has been attempting to shape the government according to Confucian ideals. His initial successes in reformation appear however to have backfired after he went too far in attacking the old order of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')], weakening their hold on power by securing the preponderance of Neo-Confucians in the government and enraging them through proposed land confiscations.\n\nThe [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] now claim [jo_gwang_jo.GetNameWithNoTooltip] to be a traitor who is planning to attempt to enthrone himself, as well as argue that his reforms are misguided and will harm society and the very foundations of the state. For his part, [jo_gwang_jo.GetNameWithNoTooltip] insists that the only correct course of action is to continue the reforms with all haste, despite the opposition. Who should we side with?"
 flavor_kor.103.a: "Purge the Neo-Confucians!"
 flavor_kor.103.b: "The reforms must continue - whatever it takes!"

 
 flavor_kor.104.title: "[yi_sun_sin.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_kor.104.desc: "Recently, the trial of [yi_sun_sin.GetName] has garnered a lot of attention in the upper echelons of our military. Charged with desertion and negligence, [yi_sun_sin.GetLastNameWithNoTooltip] has been imprisoned for some time now; yet despite frequent torture, he still refuses to admit [yi_sun_sin.GetHerHis] guilt.\n\nWhat is more, the [yi_sun_sin.GetWomanMan] seems to possess a natural understanding of military matters, and [yi_sun_sin.GetHerHis] service record shows a string of remarkable successes in repelling raids from across our borders. [yi_sun_sin.GetLastNameWithNoTooltip]'s reputation of discipline and bravery is inconsistent with the charges brought before [yi_sun_sin.GetHerHim], and so the whole trial reeks of a plot to frame the [yi_sun_sin.GetWomanMan].\n\nThere is talk of demoting [yi_sun_sin.GetHerHim] to the rank of common foot soldier, but surely the [yi_sun_sin.GetWomanMan]'s talents should not be wasted in such a lowly position."
 flavor_kor.104.a: "[yi_sun_sin.GetSheHe|U] must be reinstated as a leader at once."
 flavor_kor.104.b: "It is better not to meddle with the justice system."

 flavor_kor.200.desc: "A rumor is spreading in the court about a brilliant young man from [ShowLocationName('gongju')]. The courtesans say that he is a talented military leader and an astonishing poet whose talent is being wasted in an unimportant bureaucratic position in the provinces.\n\nShall we invite him to serve the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] directly?
