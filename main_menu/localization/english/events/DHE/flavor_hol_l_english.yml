It settled the controversy over Arminianism, condemned it, rejected the Arminian views and set forth the Reformed doctrine on each point, namely total depravity, unconditional election, limited atonement, irresistible grace, and the perseverance of the saints. The Remonstrants, as the Arminians were known, were directed to abstain from ministerial activities such as preaching, exhorting, administering the sacraments, and visiting the sick. They were also requested to sign The Act of Cessation, the legalization of the order to desist from the ministry but refused to sign it and were sentenced as 'disturbers of the public peace' and ordered to leave the United Provinces.

 flavor_hol.27.desc: "Prosperity and stability shape the current history of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Inspired by this [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCulture.GetName] Golden Age, artists from all corners of our nation are producing great paintings never seen before by mankind."
 flavor_hol.27.historical_info: "The Dutch Golden Age painting flourished in the 17th century during the Dutch Republic's peak, marked by prosperity and innovation in trade, science, and art. Departing from traditional religious themes, Dutch artists embraced secular subjects with detailed realism, shaping distinct genres like portraiture, genre scenes, landscapes, seascapes, and still lifes. This specialization in painting genres, observed from the late 1620s to 1672, epitomized the era's artistic identity and influenced Western painting's future trajectory."

 flavor_hol.28.title: "[ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('wisselbank')]"
 flavor_hol.28.desc: "With the volatility of precious metals used to mint coins, especially [ShowGoodsName('silver')], the need for a stable silver bank currency becomes apparent to many. Several [ShowPopTypeName('burghers')], past members of the city council, have proposed to create an exchange bank that would be the guarantor for this very needed currency value stability.\n\nNot everyone is on board with this idea, mostly among the [ShowPopTypeName('nobles')] who see this as a new way for the [ShowPopTypeNameWithNoTooltip('burghers')] to get more power for themselves. While this is not necessarily untrue, there is virtue in the proposal as it would lead to better control on the value of the currencies with which we trade."
 flavor_hol.28.a: "Build the exchange bank."
 flavor_hol.28.b: "We do not need it."
 flavor_hol.28.historical_info: "Established in 1609, the Bank of Amsterdam, or Wisselbank, was an early exchange bank endorsed by the city of Amsterdam. Considered by some as the first true central bank, it played a crucial role in defending coinage standards and introduced the first international reserve currency, the bank guilder. The Wisselbank influenced state banks across Europe, but a shift in policy and defaults during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War led to its insolvency in 1790. The City of Amsterdam assumed control in 1791, and the Nederlandsche Bank took over money issuance duties in 1814, leading to the Wisselbank's liquidation in 1819."

One of the nearest sources is the provinces of the [ShowAreaName('baltic_area')]. Two key issues prevent us from securing these grain supplies. The first and most important one is the Sound Toll in [ShowLocationName('kobenhavn')], preventing any [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] from trading more intensely there, as they have to pay a high toll to pass through. The other important issue is the dominion that the [ShowCultureGroupName('german_group')] nations have there, making it harder for anyone else to compete. Perhaps by using clever diplomacy, or by combating these issues with force, we can finally secure our grain supplies."
