 flavor_plc.1.desc: "A need has risen for a new holy order in the [GetCountry('FRA').GetLongName] after the loss of prestige that the Order of Saint Michael has suffered. This new order shall obtain seniority in its homeland through precedence, gaining fame and influence through the induction of some of the most powerful rulers and nobles within [GetCountry('FRA').GetNameWithNoTooltip].\n\nThe Order of the Holy Spirit, as it shall be known, will consist of eight ecclesiastical members, four offices, and one hundred knights while gaining membership will demand the most strict requirements of faith and statute.

 flavor_plc.1.historical_info: "Founded by King Henry III of France during his tenure on the Polish throne, the Order of the Holy Spirit began operating on December 31st 1578. Its goal was to restore the prestige lost by the Order of Saint Michael during the French Wars of Religion. The inspiration came from an earlier order created by Louis of Anjou in 1353, which Henry III encountered in Venice. The new order, dedicated to the Holy Spirit, was reserved for high-ranking princes and nobles, creating a two-tier system with the Order of Saint Michael, now meant for lesser servants of the Crown. This initiative sought to honor Henry III's dual ascension as King of Poland and France, both occurring on Pentecosts, and revived the historical Order of the Knot founded in the 14th century."
