Having constructed several fortifications over the Dnieper, they now intend to make their stay there, hoping for one day to achieve a self-governing status within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip].\n\nOther nations as well have noticed this, and are now planning how to properly utilize this desperation of this new Sich into complete control over the area."
 flavor_zaz.1.historical_info: "The Zaporozhian Sich stands as the most famous of the cossacks. Founded between the late 15th and 16th century, its emergence is attributed to the construction of the Khortytsia castle near the Dnieper river. They would go on to serve the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth against the rising Ottomans, but would eventually rebel and join the Russian Empire, but even then they would truggle to maintain their cossack identity. Eventually they would be disbanded and by 1775 they were replaced by the Danubian Sich."

 flavor_zaz.2.desc: "Despite our status as a loyal [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] within the [target_international_organization.GetName], many people, including [target_character.GetName], have noticed how distant [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has become from [target_country.GetName].

They, however, think that we have not rewarded them with enough gifts, so they request that we forge their elites several regalia in order to signify their authority over the rest of the [target_country2.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('cossacks_estate')]. We could respect their demands and forge them, although many debate that the coffers of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] should not be spent on such trivial cases and instead should be directed into improving the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
