In order to keep the northern [ShowCultureGroupName('german_group')] territory administrated, [GetCharacter('ubv_ludwig_iv_wittelsbach').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] assigned the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] March to [GetCharacter('ubv_ludwig_iv_wittelsbach').GetHisHer] [GetCharacter('bra_ludwig_v_wittelsbach').GetDaughterSon], [GetCharacter('bra_ludwig_v_wittelsbach').GetName]."
 flavor_bra_dynasty.1.desc: "$flavor_bra_dynasty.1.desc.start$\n\nThis is the start of the $bra_wittelsbach_hyperlink$ era of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] and a period of trouble as the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] was placed as ruler at a young age, leaving much of the government in the hands of [GetCharacter('hnb_berthold_iv_henneberg_schleusingen').GetName]. Robber barons, economic issues and a general discontent of the population towards their [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] plague the rulership of [GetCharacter('bra_ludwig_v_wittelsbach').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip], and the $bra_wittelsbach_hyperlink_no_tt$ seem to care little for their possession in the north..."

 flavor_bra_dynasty.3.desc: "At first [target_character.GetHisHer] story sounds realistic, even if a bit strange: a ruler who stages [target_character.GetHisHer] own funeral in order to go on a pilgrimage undisturbed. But as [target_character.GetHisHer] campaign for the throne continues, [target_character.GetHisHer] visage has started to show cracks. Those who knew [GetCharacter('bra_waldemar_askanier').GetName] before 1320 have noted unexplainable personality changes. Later this day, it has been finally revealed, that [target_character.GetName] is nothing but a mere imposter to the most honored Margrave!\n\nIn an instance, any form of support the pretender called [target_character.GetHisHer] own has vanished, and the rule of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] is once again undisputed."

 flavor_bra_dynasty.6.title: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] Assume Control"
 flavor_bra_dynasty.6.desc: "While the authority of the $bra_wittelsbach_hyperlink$ is present on the paper, the actual authority over the people lies in the hands of those the masses chose to follow. In the rural settlements, that would be the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')].

Most of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] is made with the taxes on the towns and cities.

 flavor_bra_dynasty.9.desc: "[target_character.GetHisHer|U] death came swift and unexpected, yet [target_character.GetHisHer] legacy still haunts [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. [target_character.GetName], the supposed $bra_askanier_hyperlink$ who ruled over our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] until 1320, has turned out to be the most deceptive imposter and schemer in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] history. At [target_character.GetHisHer] funeral, [target_character.GetHisHer] old grave has been dug up so [target_character.GetHeShe] can rest for good.
