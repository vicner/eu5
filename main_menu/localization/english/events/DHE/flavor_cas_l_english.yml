 flavor_cas.2604.historical_info: "The effect of the Bourbon Reforms was one of the primary factors that drove Spanish colonial subjects to independence. These reforms removed administrative powers from local elites and gave authority to crown-appointed officials. Though from the financial point of view, the reforms fulfilled their purpose, they alienated the local elites who felt disenfranchised. Combined with rising increased economic burdens, these reforms significantly undermined colonial loyalty. The widespread resentment eventually contributed to independence movements across Spanish America in the early 19th century."
 
 flavor_cas.2605.title: "A Call for Independence"
 flavor_cas.2605.desc: "Due to the harsh reforms adopted by [overlord_country.GetName], and their efforts to enforce them upon us, our people have been growing increasingly discontent with our overlord, and the entire society seems to be pushing the colonial government to cast off the burdensome yoke of [overlord_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip]. If we do not act now, we may never get another chance."
 flavor_cas.2605.a: "Let the war for independence begin!"
 flavor_cas.2605.b: "Now is not the time for war."
 flavor_cas.2605.historical_info: "The American Spanish Wars of Independence was a series of conflicts with various catalysts, be it the harsh reforms adopted by the Bourbon dynasty, or the impacts of the Peninsular War waged by Napoleon. Colonial elites and native populations, previously loyal, were disillusioned by Spain's instability and were able to rally almost everyone to their cause. The result was the almost total disintegration of the Spanish colonial rule in the Americas in the span of a few decades."

 flavor_cas.2606.desc: "[colonial_country.GetName], one of our colonial subjects, has declared war upon us. They reject our authority and proclaim their intent to break free from our rule. The shock of betrayal stings deeply, but now is not the time for grief. We must rally our forces and do everything in our power to bring the colonies back under our rightful rule."

With the introduction of the new [ShowGovernmentReformName('intendancy_system')], local power holders are being sidelined in favor of [overlord_country.GetGoverment.GetEstateName('crown_estate')]-appointed officials. The economic burden has also grown heavier, as taxes are raised and tribute is strictly enforced."
 flavor_cas.2700.a: "We must obey their will."
 flavor_cas.2700.b: "We shall not bow to their decisions!"
 flavor_cas.2700.historical_info: "In the mid-to-late 18th century, the Spanish Crown initiated the Bourbon Reforms, which was a series of centralizing policies designed to improve colonial efficiency. One of the most disruptive measures was the adoption of the Intendancy System, which replaced older, more autonomous local authorities with officials loyal to the Crown. In places like Peru, these reforms undermined the influence of local elites and Indigenous authorities alike, generating resentment among both the upper and lower classes."

 flavor_cas.2701.desc: "A local named José Gabriel Condorcanqui, claiming descent from the ancient Inca emperors, has begun to stir the people of the highlands. Taking the name [target_character.GetName], [target_character.GetSheHe] denounces the new taxes, the abuse of the indigenous peoples, and the destruction of local autonomy. [target_character.GetSheHe|U] threatens to launch a full-blown rebellion, since [target_character.GetHisHer] cause is being supported by thousands of locals."

 flavor_cas.2701.historical_info: "In 1780, José Gabriel Condorcanqui, a mestizo claiming Inca descent, took the name Tupac Amaru II and initiated a rebellion near Cuzco. Frustrated by the abuses of power and the suffering of indigenous people, he sought to end forced labor systems and other colonial oppressions. The rebellion attracted tens of thousands of Indigenous fighters, merchants, and disenfranchised locals."

 flavor_cas.2702.historical_info: "The rebellion led by Tupac Amaru II, though initially successful in rallying thousands of indigenous and mestizo supporters across Southern and Upper Peru, was ultimately crushed by the superior military power and organizational reach of the Spanish colonial authorities. For the indigenous population, the defeat was very tragic. Many had hoped for a restoration of autonomy or at least relief from colonial abuses, but instead found themselves subject to even greater repression, with cultural expressions of Inca identity and local leadership structures increasingly outlawed or dismantled by the state."

 flavor_cas.2703.desc: "[target_character.GetName], the leader of the crushed rebellion, has been captured. Although many call for mercy, others demand justice for the spilled blood of our loyal subjects. The colonial elite is split between making an example of [target_character.GetHimHer] or letting [target_character.GetHimHer] go, but this would come with a risk that [target_character.GetHisHer] legacy may ignite more unrest in years to come."

 flavor_cas.2703.historical_info: "Tupac Amaru II was captured, publicly executed in Cuzco, and forced to witness the death of his family and allies. His execution was designed as a brutal warning to others. Despite this, he became a lasting symbol of Indigenous resistance."
