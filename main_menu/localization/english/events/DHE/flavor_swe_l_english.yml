 flavor_swe.1.historical_info: "Upon his ascension to the Swedish throne, Gustav Vasa was faced with a seemingly endless list of discouraging tasks. The country was in massive debt to the Hansa, who threatened to side with Denmark in its attempts to restore the Union, the nobles were untrustworthy, and the army and navy were in shambles. Worst of all, however, was the unbalanced distribution of land. The crown lands were too small to provide the vital taxes needed to support the state. The King proved up to the challenge, and with unpopular reductions and obsessive micromanagement, he got the country back on its feet. In his early reign, Gustav also sought to gain the Skåne counties and Gotland from Denmark with the Hansa's help. He was unsuccessful, yet the claim had been staked..."

We now stand on a precipice: If we allow [ShowCultureNameWithNoTooltip('danish')] domination to continue, this upstart's supporters will strike out against us. But if we back the rebels, we face the wrath of our ruling class. The next step must be carefully considered..."
 flavor_swe.2.historical_info: "Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson is a legendary and enigmatic figure in Swedish medieval history. In 1434, the peasants of Dalarna (The Dales) in Sweden had had enough of King Erik's crushing taxes and brutal methods of law enforcement. The peasants and miners, led by Engelbrekt and supported by certain factions within the Church and gentry, rose up in open rebellion. They captured castle after castle and soon controlled the greater part of Sweden. Meanwhile, Erik Puke had joined Engelbrekt in revolt in Finland. For two years, Engelbrekt was the de facto ruler of Sweden, but intrigue among the noblemen and infighting between Engelbrekt, Erik Puke, and Karl Knutsson finally resulted in Engelbrekt's murder at the hands of Måns Bengtsson Natt och Dag."

If the [ShowCultureName('swedish')] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] choose to, they could repudiate earlier agreements made with the government, since these aggressions are a clear violation of the agreed-upon terms.

 flavor_swe.3.historical_info: "Following Sweden's victory over Russia in 1497, the scheming Union King Hans realized he had to curb the power of the Swedish marshal Sten Sture (the elder). Defeating the Swedes at Rotebro, he marched into Stockholm and was crowned King of Sweden, but only after granting amnesty to Sten Sture and the rebels. This event was called the 'Kalmar Recess'. In 1500, following King Hans's crushing defeat by the peasant rebels in the Ditmarsk, Sten Sture and the Swedish nobles rejected the Kalmar Recess, claiming Hans had not been honoring the agreement. This was to mark the beginning of the end for the Union of Kalmar."

It seems many rulers in our part of the world, inspired by [GetCharacter('martin_luther').GetName] and his 95 Theses, are embracing new religious ideals and subsequently seizing valuable assets formerly owned by the Church. If we did the same, it could be an opportunity not only to refill our coffers, but to more decisively consolidate our power."
 flavor_swe.4.historical_info: "During the Swedish liberation war, the Crown had accrued enormous debts to the Hanseatic League, and Gustav Vasa needed money quickly in order to placate the powerful merchants. At the Parliament of Västerås in the summer of 1527, he took the first step towards Protestantism when the Church was obliged to 'lend' the state money in the form of silver chalices, bells, and other valuable objects. Over the coming three decades, Sweden gradually slipped into the evangelic faith despite several uprisings."

In the early 1550s, he studied law at the University of Wittenberg and returned to Sweden with a letter of recommendation from the German theologian and reformer Philipp Melanchton. He quickly distinguished himself, and rose to become King Eric XIV's most trusted councilor as well as head of the King's network of spies. Persson also acted as the King's prosecutor and was responsible for a large number of the three hundred death sentences handed down by the High Court. He was widely seen as a Machiavellian figure, holding too much influence over Eric. After King Eric was removed from power, Persson was arrested by the nobility and executed.

It may behoove us to permit more of these talented [ShowCultureNameWithNoTooltip('walloon')] people to settle in our lands."
 flavor_swe.7.historical_info: "In 1614, the Walloon entrepreneur Louis de Geer set up shop in Sweden and undertook the development of the iron ore mining and foundries in northern Sweden. For some time already, Walloon craftsmen from the Hainaut, Brabant, and Luxembourg regions had been fleeing unemployment and immigrating to Sweden. The influx of master metal workers and ore refiners vitalized the industry and led to a massive improvement in steel quality - a major advantage in weapons manufacture.

One of our high-ranking officials has devised an ingenious recruitment system that brings conscripts from the same region together into squads of fighters, called 'regiments.' Being that they have the same origins, each regiment will be strongly bonded and more motivated to keep one another safe. Moreover, both our technology and our battlefield tactics could be more agile than they currently are... Yes, it is time to reform our military into something modern and uniquely tailored to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s strengths!"
 flavor_swe.8.historical_info: "In the early 17th century, Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus undertook a set of measures to reform the Swedish military system. Sweden would develop a professional army around the conscription of soldiers on the basis of same geographical origin (cities, hamlets, villages) that would bring team spirit and cohesion to units that did not exist in most mercenary armies of the time. The tactical innovations included shallower and broader formations to maximize firepower, cross-training between the army branches, and light, highly mobile field artillery. The new Swedish tactical doctrine was based on firepower and mobility, eschewing heavy artillery and slow-moving tercios."

Glittering with exquisite decorations and bristling with an astonishing sixty-four cannons, there is no other vessel in the world like it. When Vasa spreads it sails and makes its first gliding cut through the water, a great cheer rings throughout the harbor. \n\nBut Vasa's first elegant flight lasts no more than a few minutes. Overburdened as she is with gilt grotesques and bronze armaments, the priceless warship succumbs to a mere gust of wind, listing crazily to the side and almost immediately flooding its lower gundeck. To the shock and horror of the onlookers, Vasa sinks irrevocably to the bottom of the sea, just a few hundred feet from the shore."
 flavor_swe.9.historical_info: "The Swedish warship Vasa was built as a symbol of Sweden's military and political power and Gustavus Adolphus's authority as a warrior king. At the time, she was one of the largest and most heavily armed warships in the world. Constructed between 1626 and 1628, no expense was spared in decorating and equipping her, and she featured no fewer than 64 guns. The problem was that Vasa was built top-heavy and had insufficient ballast to support that many guns. On her maiden voyage on the 10 August 1628, the ship foundered and sank outside Beckholmen after sailing less than a nautical mile."

Between 1626 and 1628, he participated in the war against Poland, and later followed the King to Germany during the early Thirty Years War. He was made a Privy Councilor and led the peace negotiations with Poland in 1635. Two years later, he was appointed Governor General in Finland, and in 1641, as Lord High Steward. His contribution to development in Finland included introducing a postal system and the founding of several cities, among them Tavastehus and Nyslott.

He received a thorough education and spent some time in France and the Netherlands. In 1643, he returned to Sweden to take part in Torstenson's War against Denmark, where he served under Field Marshal Gustav Horn. Once a favorite of Queen Christina, he later fell out of favor with her. He became a Lieutenant General under his brother-in-law King Charles X Gustav and commanded troops in the wars against Poland and Russia. When King Charles X Gustav died in 1660, De la Gardie was appointed member of the regency council during the minority of Charles XI. He later lost more than any other noble during Charles XI's reduction, and died on April 26, 1686."

 flavor_swe.12.desc: "Our economic situation requires significant reform, and we have two potential avenues. We could adopt a mercantilist policy, which would give the government more control and higher revenues, or we could adopt a free trade policy and export our raw materials. While the latter might generate significant profits, which excessive regulation would throttle, it would also be much less lucrative for the upper classes. This is a momentous decision, and not to be taken lightly."
 flavor_swe.12.historical_info: "During the first half of the 17th century, the newly risen great power of Sweden sought ways of reforming her trade as effectively as she had the army. Foreign entrepreneurs (mostly from the Low Countries, like Louis de Geer) started up flourishing businesses and provided excellent role models for Swedish merchants. The Swedes were even persuaded by certain Dutchmen to embark on lucrative colonial ventures, but the attempts were half-hearted as Sweden chose instead to pursue an aggressive continental policy. Swedish trade never really took off either, due to the constant mercantilist interference of a money starved government."

 flavor_swe.13.historical_info: "After the disastrous war of 1674-79, which Sweden was more or less forced into by France, Charles XI and broad layers of the Swedish administration realized that something had to change. The King, in two surprisingly painless Parliament sessions in 1680 and 1682, assumed sole control of the country with no obligation to heed either Parliament or the Royal Council. Thus began the period of Caroline absolutism in Sweden, with the king called 'the Graycoat' for his humility and simple habits, answerable only to God."

He proved to be the most able administrator Sweden has ever had. Like Charles IX, Oxenstierna was impressed by Calvinism, and harbored notions of adopting at least elements of that faith. As Gustavus Adolphus's right hand man, he fought against the King's plans to intervene in the Thirty Years War. However, after the death of the King at Lützen in 1632, he assumed the leadership of the Protestant cause and managed to convince the French to actively participate in the conflict. He always followed domestic policies closely, but lost most of his influence following the abdication of Queen Christina, which he opposed.

We must think carefully on this."
 flavor_swe.16.historical_info: "Upon Gustavus Adolphus's not-entirely-unexpected but greatly feared demise at Lützen on November 6, 1632, Axel Oxenstierna had to shoulder the full burden of governing the realm as head regent for Gustavus's six year old daughter Christina. The brilliant administrator kept the nation running smoothly, but the aristocratic tendencies that had been kept in check by the late king were unleashed in full by the high lords of the regency, to the great detriment of the lower classes and the Crown. One of the other five regents was Carl Carlsson Gyllenhielm, bastard brother to Gustavus and high admiral of the realm. Of the lot, he was the least concerned with personal wealth and privileges."

But we cannot fail to pay for our military commitments, meaning that this money must be found somewhere. Since the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] pay almost nothing while holding the most productive lands, it stands to reason that they should shoulder this burden, but of course we cannot expect them to accept this without grumbling.\n\nWe have three imperfect solutions to this problem.

 flavor_swe.17.historical_info: "Charles Gustavus's selection as Crown Prince came about only with promises of change for the peasants and burghers at the Riksdag of 1650. Thus, when he succeeded Christina to the throne in 1654, he felt an obligation to lighten their burden as well as to strengthen the state finances. As always, there were only two real ways of accomplishing this - reduction, or increased contributions from the aristocracy. With great reluctance, the nobles agreed to a limited reduction. After all, increased contributions were almost the same thing as paying taxes, something nobles simply did not do."

An assiduous politician, Christina was able to keep the bitter class rivalries that broke out after the war from lapsing into civil war, but was unable to solve the desperate financial problems caused by the long years of fighting.

Soon after he was dead, however, the Council and the House of Lords managed to replace two of his closest supporters, Prince Adolf Johan and Herman Fleming, with the more pliable Lars Kagg and Gustav Bonde.

 flavor_swe.20.historical_info: "The Swedish kings of the 16th and 17th centuries alternated between acceptance and dislike of the nobility. In Gustav Vasa's time, there was little difference between a rich farmer and a nobleman, but the situation changed towards the end of his life. Erik XIV kept the nobles on a short leash, whereas his brother John wanted to expand their privileges. The third brother, who was to become Charles IX, hated the nobility with an almost revolutionary fervor and surrounded himself with men of the lower classes, toying with ideas that were unheard of in his time. Under Gustavus Adolphus and Axel Oxenstierna, the pendulum swung the other way and the nobles gained both land and power. This tendency came to an abrupt end with Charles XI who, after the humiliating defeat of Sweden in 1679, commenced a policy of wide scale reductions of the lands and powers of the nobility and also abolished the special privileges of the Baltic lords."

While some past rulers addressed the problem by seizing property and other contentious acts, we have developed a way for our armies to sustain themselves. Not only will our fighters be producing their own foodstuffs, but we have devised a form of sponsorship where ordinary farmers can support a soldier in exchange for tax and military service exemptions. This more sustainable system also removes some of the existing class barriers, strengthening the camaraderie between our soldiers and erasing old resentments. All that is left is to officially implement these new guidelines..."
 flavor_swe.21.historical_info: "Charles XI was not a great warrior king like his father and his son, but he was a great reorganizer and consolidator. Apart from his centralization efforts and huge reduction of aristocratic land holdings, he also remodeled the army. Most importantly, he devised the genial 'indelningsverk', or military-tenure system. The system was a military organization where the soldiers were given a croft to live on and cultivate (made possible by the reduction), where the harvest served as their wages. Thus the country could maintain a large army in both times of peace and of war. If a peasant assumed the responsibility of maintaining an enlisted rider, his horse, and his equipment, the peasant was exempted from conscription and freed from paying taxes. The peasants could cooperate in groups of 2-5 farms and maintain a soldier or a sailor. The soldiers were organized into companies of 150 men, and every county should field a regiment of 1200 men. The new system also made no distinction between officers of noble birth and commoners."

It was originally adopted by soldiers who were held as prisoners of war and thus obliged to hold their own religious services; however, mainstream religious leaders bitterly disapprove of unauthorized preaching. Signing the proposed edict will make private religious gatherings against the law, which will please mainstream believers but runs the risk of angering the new faith's adherents."
 flavor_swe.22.historical_info: "Pietism was a religious movement that started in Germany during the latter part of the 17th century. Traditionally, the Pietist movement was viewed as a backlash against the intellectualism prevalent in and among the Protestant ranks, especially in the Lutheran Church, during that period. The poor Swedish soldiers, who spent long years as prisoners in Tobolsk following the battle of Poltava, had to hold their own Lutheran Masses, thus learning to appreciate pietism. It was with their return that the movement really took off in Sweden. However, the Swedish Lutheran Church disapproved most strongly of unauthorized preaching, leading to the Conventicle Edict of 1726, which forbade any religious gatherings outside the framework of the Church."

Not only did they secretly meet with our enemies, they did so in the hopes that [target_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip] would support their bid to form an independent [ShowCultureNameWithNoTooltip('finnish')] state in exchange.\n\nThis sort of perfidy would normally be resolved with a few well-deserved executions, but we will be unable to win this war without the exemplary military leadership these officers provide. Yet if we capitulate, we will look weak for allowing our own officers to make treasonous demands of their own sovereign. We must decide carefully which outcome is the least damaging to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s position on the world stage."
 flavor_swe.23.historical_info: "Gustavus III, the 'Theater King', declared war on Russia in the summer of 1788. His main goals were to reclaim the honor of the Swedish military, retake some land that had been lost to Russia in previous wars, and - perhaps most importantly - to put a stop to the incessant Russian meddling in Swedish politics. At the time, Sweden had a magnificent fleet and a rather effective army, but most of the officers could be described as politicians rather than soldiers. The Swedish army began marching on Saint Petersburg and won some minor battles despite the compact resistance from the officers. On August 12, a group of 112 Finnish noble officers formed the 'Anjala League' and opened up negotiations with the Russians, declaring the war to be illegal and probing for the possibility of an independent Finnish state. This event effectively ended all hopes of a Swedish victory since the king was in a poor position to execute the traitors and have them replaced."

 flavor_swe.24.historical_info: "The devastating loss of Finland in 1809 was widely blamed on King Gustav IV Adolf, and on March 13, 1809, he was deposed in a coup d'état by certain liberal officials and officers in Sweden's western army. Gustavus and his heirs were deprived of their royal titles and encouraged to leave the country. The deposed king eventually settled in Switzerland under the name of Colonel Gustafsson. While the search went on for a new Crown Prince, Sweden was ruled by Gustavus's aged and childless uncle Charles (XIII). The Danish prince Christian August was elected, but died suddenly in 1810. The Riksdag frantically cast about for a replacement and finally decided on the French marshal Jean-Baptist Bernadotte."

 flavor_swe.26.historical_info: "In response to the rising clamor for more power to the aristocracy, Gustav III appealed to the three lower estates (clergy, burghers, and peasants) of the Riksdag and in 1789 established a new constitution that augmented the royal authority. This Act of Union and Security was in effect almost a return to the days of absolutism under Charles XI and XII. It proved too much for the aristocracy, however, and the King was murdered while at the Stockholm opera house on March 16, 1792"

 flavor_swe.28.historical_info: "Dissatisfaction with the lords's government grew amongst the peasants during the Age of Liberty. The Russian victory in the Hat faction's Russian War of 1741-1743 and the question of succession after the childless Frederick I were the main reasons. The dissatisfaction was even stronger in the province of Dalarna where the Hats had introduced restrictions on the Dalecarlians' free trade with Norway. In 1743, the peasants of Dalarna rebelled in what became known as the Great Dalecarlian Dance. They were joined by the local regiment, who had suffered heavy casualties at the bloody battle of Villmanstrand in 1741. The election of the Danish Crown Prince Frederick as king and a harsh inquisition against the generals responsible for the disastrous Russian War became the uprising's main objectives. The mob armed themselves, and on 11 June, started to march on Stockholm."
