 flavor_mal.1.desc: "During the reign of [mal_mansa_musa_ruler.GetName], the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] has reached the pinnacle of power in $west_africa$. Truly blessed by Allāh, the great [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has ruled [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] with strength and wisdom, and even has shown the great wealth of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] to the rest of the world during [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerHis] Ḥajj.\n\nHowever, the wheel of fortune cannot turn forever in our favor. [mal_maghan_ruler.GetName] has never been of great significance and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] is facing social issues with so many diverse cultures present in the state.\n\nOnly time will tell what might happen to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip]..."
 flavor_mal.1.a: "May these prospering times find no end."
 flavor_mal.1.a.tt: "We might become subject to the [ShowDisasterName('decline_of_empire')] [disaster|e] should our [control|e] over our lands decays under weak leadership"
 flavor_mal.1_historical_info: "As the most famous ruler of the Mali Empire, Mansa Mūsā is renowned for his immense wealth and influence. Under his reign, Mali became a center of trade, culture, and Islamic learning, with Timbuktu flourishing as a hub of scholarship. His legendary pilgrimage to Mecca showcased his vast riches, as he distributed so much gold that it impacted regional economies. Mūsā expanded Mali's territory, strengthening control over vital trade routes. His patronage of architecture and education left a lasting legacy, with mosques and madrasas that shaped West African history. His reign symbolizes the height of Mali's power and prosperity."

 flavor_mal.2.title: "[mal_suleyman_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip], the Brother of [mal_mansa_musa_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_mal.2.desc: "While [mal_maghan_ruler.GetName] has not shown any promising skills for ruling a state, his uncle [mal_suleyman_ruler.GetName] has proven his abilities during [mal_mansa_musa_ruler.GetName]'s great Ḥajj as regent of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. The support for [mal_suleyman_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] as the new [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] is strong. However, [mal_maghan_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] is the current ruler of our state, and it goes against the traditional laws of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] to usurp [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerHim]."
 flavor_mal.2.a: "Let [mal_suleyman_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] rule over [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 flavor_mal.2.b: "[mal_maghan_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] inherited the throne. [mal_maghan_ruler.GetHeShe|U] shall prove [mal_maghan_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] first."

 flavor_mal.3.title: "The Transformation of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] Military"
 flavor_mal.3.desc: "The armies of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] used to be made up of #italic Horons#! - 'free men', who brought their own weaponry to the battle and were trained in the arts of war. With the increasing usage of [ShowUnitDefinitionName('a_sofa_infantry')], the character of our military is shifting. No more is the state protected by our well-trained part-time soldiers but by an army of #italic Jonows#! — 'slaves' — who once were just the carrier of the military equipment.\n\nOpinions are split if such development is to our advantage or not. While the quality of our army is less secure, it is undeniable that the quantity of the Sofa troops is a force to be reckoned with."
 flavor_mal.3.a: "Let us utilize the $a_sofa_infantry$ more."
 flavor_mal.3.b: "We should not replace the Horon with these slaves."

 flavor_mal.4.title: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')] and the [GetCountry('POR').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_mal.4.desc: "Having adopted a less violent approach, [GetCountry('POR').GetAdjective] traders have become an increasingly common sight along our western borders. In many ways, this is a boon to our state as it has given us much easier access to horses for our armies and a way to procure valuable goods from the many exotic ports frequented by [GetCountry('POR').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] merchants. For gold or slaves, there is not much the [GetCountry('POR').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] would not sell us; our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] are thriving due to this new partnership.\n\nThere is, however, a slight worry about this development in some camps, the amount of slaves to a horse seems to keep increasing by the day and while our own transoceanic ventures have not gone so well it would seem less than prudent to rely entirely on these foreign merchants as they surely cannot have our best interests at heart."
 flavor_mal.4.a: "A fruitful relationship for everyone...?"
 
 flavor_mal.5.title: "[GetCountry('POR').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] Meddling"
 flavor_mal.5.desc: "The [GetCountry('POR').GetAdjective] traders on our western coast have become quite a nuisance lately. While the horses they bring for our armies and the exotic goods they bring from faraway countries are of great use to us, it seems they cannot help but meddle in local politics. It is clear that several chiefs that are in contact with the [GetCountry('POR').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] have been encouraged to extend their personal authority and to slowly attempt to cut ties with our central administration.\n\nIn order to deal with this we could either strike at the chiefs themselves or attempt to limit the influence of the [GetCountry('POR').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip]."
 flavor_mal.5.a: "Act decisively to limit [GetCountry('POR').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] influence."
 flavor_mal.5.b: "The problem lies with the disloyal chiefs."
 
 flavor_mal.6.title: "Islamization of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')]"
 flavor_mal.6.desc: "While our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] is Islamic in name, the old religion of our forefathers is still very much a force to be reckoned with. Islam has, however, been gaining more ground lately among the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')], and wandering marabouts have also become an increasingly common sight even in the farthest corners of our lands.\n\nIn the past, our predecessors have all avoided being too forceful about converting their subjects, but if we wish, we could probably make use of these recent developments to encourage the spread of the true faith."
 flavor_mal.6.a: "Let us convert our people!"
 flavor_mal.6.b: "Let us not rock the boat."
 
 flavor_mal.7.title: "Access to Gunpowder Weaponry"
 flavor_mal.7.desc: "For centuries, our men have relied on javelins and bows. These were the ways of our ancestors, and so are they the ways of our current generation of warriors. Yet, those strangers from [mal_arms_dealer.GetName] possess weapons never seen before in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Although our own traditional weapons surpass those foreign tools of destruction, it is clear that this 'gunpowder weaponry' has the potential to replace the bow. Military advisors recommend that we gain access to these guns by purchasing them from the [mal_arms_dealer.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] merchants."
 flavor_mal.7.a: "We should request guns from [mal_arms_dealer.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 flavor_mal.7.a.tt: "We will try to purchase gunpowder weaponry from [mal_arms_dealer.GetName].\nThe price is #R [ROOT.GetVariable('mal_gun_price').GetValue|V2]#! if [mal_arms_dealer.GetNameWithNoTooltip] accepts. In return, the [mal_arms_buyer.GetAdjective] military and war economy will see a large boost"

 flavor_mal.8.title: "[mal_arms_buyer.GetNameWithNoTooltip] requests Access to Guns"
 flavor_mal.8.desc: "Curious news has reached our court, as the merchants of [mal_arms_buyer.GetName], sent by their [mal_arms_buyer.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] [mal_arms_buyer.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerselfHimself], make us an offer to sell our firearms as well as our weapon expertise to them. While granting them access to our arsenal might give us a grateful ally in $west_africa$, it could threaten our outstanding business opportunities with [mal_arms_buyer.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 flavor_mal.8.a: "There is no benefit to us to sell guns to them."
 flavor_mal.8.b: "This might be a profitable business."

 flavor_mal.9.desc: "Great news has reached the court, as the merchants of [mal_arms_dealer.GetName] have agreed to sell gunpowder weapons, as well as the necessary resources and knowledge to produce these weapons ourselves! The military of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can finally adapt to the changing nature of warfare!"
 flavor_mal.9.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('common_string_positive')]"

 flavor_mal.10.title: "[mal_arms_dealer.GetNameWithNoTooltip] refuses Access to Gunpowder Weapons!"
 flavor_mal.10.desc: "News of great concern has reached the court, as despite our best attempts and promises, the foul merchants of [mal_arms_dealer.GetName] refuse our pleas to buy their gunpowder weaponry. They replied only with accursed excuses while demanding a higher toll of additional slaves. It is obvious that these spawns of Jahannam are not interested in the survival of their business partner."
 flavor_mal.10.a: "These insidious snakes..."

 flavor_mal.11.title: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] in the Defensive"
 flavor_mal.11.desc: "The wars against the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] are showing their toll. More and more territory is lost to those who seek our destruction; more and more our bravest men are forced to go into the defensive while the hordes of ungrateful traitors and marauding tribes push into our land.\n\nAs tragic as things are, at least these wars show [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] tenacity. However, the voices in the military command argue that our defensive strategy will lead to our doom. Going into the offensive and bringing the fight to our enemies is the only way to restore the glory of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
 flavor_mal.11.a: "This is madness, the army just cannot leave our land."
 flavor_mal.11.b: "They are right! Defending will only delay our demise."

 flavor_mal.12.title: "The Farima-Soura & Sankar-Zouma"
 flavor_mal.12.desc: "Our borders are often perilous, and many merchants across the domain have fallen victim to illicit banditry and crime. Despite our best efforts, we have failed to establish the rule of law and bring our borderlands closer to our court in [target_location.GetName].\n\nThus, many influential members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] have voiced their concerns and have brought forth ideas about delegating some power to them, particularly around the northern and southern border."
 flavor_mal.12.a: "The Farima-Soura will serve us faithfully."

 flavor_mal.13.title: "The Sankore Madrasa"
 flavor_mal.13.desc: "Few establishments and centers of learning are as illustrious and celebrated as the [ShowBuildingTypeName('madrasa')] in [target_location.GetName]. Originally built around the roots of the Sankore [ShowBuildingTypeName('temple')], the madrasa was founded with the financial backing of a [ShowCultureName('mandinka')] woman.\n\nSince then, the institution has not only prospered under the guide of great men, such as [GetCharacter('mal_musa_keita').GetName], but also continues receiving several students, who visit its premises from every corner of the continent to obtain the wisdom within its walls."
 flavor_mal.13.a: "This is the shining example of our innovative thought!"
 flavor_mal.13.b: "We shall admire it but we cannot fund it even more..."

 flavor_mal.14.desc: "Despite our attempts at improving the lives of all our subjects, there are those among us that wish to see us fall, to eradicate our legacy. They plot in the shadows, daggers at hand, waiting to strike at our moments of weakness...\n\n[target_subject_country.GetName]'s voice of dissent is nothing but a performance of a petulant child that has grown too bold and eager."

 flavor_mal.15.desc: "Despite our best attempts to convince [target_overlord_country.GetName] and their uncultured swine-like royals that we simply wish to coexist in peace under no bondage, they seem to demand our total and complete subjugation. This insult should surely serve as fuel to stoke the fires of independence across our borders!"

 flavor_mal.17.b: "We will put them to the sword, all of them!"

 flavor_mal.18.title: "A Fragmented Realm"
 flavor_mal.18.desc: "Many within our ranks seem to believe that our great nation is falling apart. Regional revolts, prospecting pretenders, and harsh weather patterns have led to many speculating that our end is nigh. Adding salt to our wounds, now many of our subjects to our eastern territories demand their complete independence from our authority after kicking out our local administrators and putting the local crown representatives to the sword!"
 flavor_mal.18.a: "Harsh terms but we will accept..."

 flavor_mal.19.desc: "Although the mines of [target_location2.GetName] have served us well in the past, recently there has been an influx of investments in [target_location.GetName]. [target_character.GetName] has been approached by the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')], requesting that we invest in the latter."
 flavor_mal.19.historical_info: "Salt in the Mali Empire was considered more valuable than gold due to its worth in foreign markets. For that reason, Taghaza and its mines were profitable for anyone who had the workforce for them. In the 16th century, due to numerous wars, the mines were abandoned in favor of the ones in Taoudenni."
 flavor_mal.19.a: "A few gold coins for [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."

We can try to offer them residence in our settlements, or we can try to put a tax on their cattle."
 flavor_mal.23.historical_info: "Since the founding of the Mali Empire, the Fulbe people have been in charge of the cattle-rearing of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. They would often share their lands with other nearby groups, and their wealth was measured by how large their herd was."

 flavor_mal.24.historical_info: "Although it is only a myth that Ko Mamadi might have discovered the Americas with his voyages, it can be said that his failure to return contributed to the rise of Mansa Mūsā in the Mali Empire and a focus on internal stability rather than discovery and innovation."
