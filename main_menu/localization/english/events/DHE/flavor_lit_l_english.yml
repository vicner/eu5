The conversion began in 1387 when Grand Duke Jogaila was baptized to marry Queen Jadwiga of Poland, solidifying a Polish-Lithuanian alliance. This event initiated the spread of Catholicism, though pagan practices lingered for some time. Later, Vytautas 'the Great', Jogaila's cousin, pushed the Christianization further, particularly in Samogitia, the last stronghold of paganism.

Grand Duke Gediminas initially considered converting to Orthodoxy, influenced by neighboring Orthodox states. However, the final attempt at conversion was made by Jogaila, who faced pressure from his Russian mother to marry Sofia, daughter of Prince Dmitri of Moscow.

This brought them into frequent interaction with the Russian principalities, particularly the rising Grand Duchy of Moscow. As both powers vied for control over these lands, tensions grew. However, Lithuania also formed strategic alliances with northern Russian republics like Novgorod and Pskov, which sought to counter Moscow's expanding influence.
