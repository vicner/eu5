 flavor_ayd.1.historical_info: "Umur Ġāzī is one of the most well-known Anatolian privateers. Mustering a powerful army and navy, his adventures across the Aegean have become the stuff of legends. His privateering activities led to a crusade being declared against his domain. Such was his military importance that he came to the aid of Byzantine Emperor John Cantacuzenus, where the Lion played a crucial role in the Byzantine civil war (1341-1347) by providing significant military support, including 380 ships and 28,000 soldiers."
