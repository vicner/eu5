 flavor_tre.1.historical_info: "Founded in 756 BCE, Trebizond has a long history as a stronghold of Christianity and Greek culture. As far back as the Roman times, the city served as a crucial legionary base in Pontos Polemoniakos. Later on, during Justinian's reign, several Armenian campaigns used Trebizond as the rally and launching point.\n\nThe city evolved into an archbishopric in the 8th century and a metropolis in the early 10th century. The Empire of Trebizond, founded in 1204 by Alexios I Komnenos and David Komnenos, lasted until 1461, fortified by the Pontic Mountains, strong city defenses, and strategic marital alliances. Though small, with about 4,000 inhabitants in 1438, it was well-defended and featured significant monuments such as the monastery of Hagia Sophia and the Cathedral of Panagia Chrysokephalos. Trebizond was the last Byzantine outpost to fall to the Ottomans, maintaining its cultural and historical significance until 1461."

 flavor_tre.2.title: "Insubordination of the Scholarioi"
 flavor_tre.2.desc: "Motivated by the waning of central authority and urged on by their insatiable greed, many members of the local noble militias have come to control large swaths of the political scene in [target_location.GetName].

 flavor_tre.2.historical_info: "The Scholarioi were influential #italic άρχοντες#! (nobles), and one of the most powerful families in Trebizond. They were originally formed as a royal militia unit tasked with protecting the city. They soon became corrupt and disputed the authority of the sitting Emperess Irene, in 1340. Their audacity and thirst for control led them to veto the ascension of Irene, throwing the entire country into civil war, while at the same time, Trebizond's southern border was harassed by Turkmen raids. This culminated in the raiders seizing the city, setting fire to it and introducing an epidemic, which arose from the foul stench of rotting corpses - men and horses alike."

 flavor_tre.3.b: "We will not stand for this!"
 flavor_tre.3.historical_info: "The marriage between Irene and Basil was naught but a way for the Komnenoi dynasty to secure an alliance with the Emperor of Byzantium, as Irene was the illegitimate daughter of Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos. While there was no affection between the two, Irene produced no children while Basil found refuge in the arms of a courtier mistress. The resentment between the royal couple eventually led to the assassination of Basil, and the beginning of the reign of Irene, a turbulent period for Trebizond."
