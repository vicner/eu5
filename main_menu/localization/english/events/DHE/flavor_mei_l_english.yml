flavor_mei.1000.desc: "Ever since our house claimed the throne of [GetCountry('THU').GetName] from the Ludovingians, tensions have simmered between us and the lesser lords of the region. We have long sought to bring the entirety of [GetCountry('THU').GetNameWithNoTooltip] under the suzerainty of the [ShowDynastyName('wettin_dynasty')] dynasty, and local counts have fiercely opposed us in this ambition. Perhaps, the time has come to finally start working on achieving this ambition, and claiming [target_country.GetName] seems as the perfect stepping stone."
flavor_mei.1000.a: "We must press our claims."
flavor_mei.1000.a.tt: "Our open hostility might push [target_country.GetName] to seek foreign support."

flavor_mei.1000.historical_info: "In 1247, the Ludovingian dynasty of Thuringia became extinct and the throne was claimed by Henry of Meissen, a member of the Wettin dynasty. Ever since the Wettin takeover, they have been attempting to unite the region under the suzerainty of their dynasty, but this alienated other princes of the region. In 1342, local houses assembled in the town of Arnstadt and forged an alliance that was meant to counter the Wettins. The conflict between the two opposing groups resulted in the Thuringian Counts' War, which alhough initially successful in resisting the Wettins, ended with their victory and strengthened grip over the region."

[root_country.GetName] has recently openly declared their ambition to unite the region under their rule, and rumours are spreading that we might be one of their first targets. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] has assembled and is pressuring the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('crown_estate')] to take an action before it is too late. They suggest sending envoys to neighboring countries and offer them alliance to counter the threat posed by [GetCountry('THU').GetNameWithNoTooltip]."

In the end, the Wettins managed to turn their lands into their fiefs, effectively turning them into vassals and achieving their goals of regional unification under the Wettin dynasty."
