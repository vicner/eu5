Lands were taken from the natives and given to cavalrymen in return for military service. After establishing the reform of land management, called the pomestie system, there, he introduced it into Muscovite. By seizing the local nobles', called boyars, estates and giving it to his army, he helped bolster and centralize his power and create loyalty in his army and other servants. By 1489, Novgorod was a shell of its former self and now part of the ever-growing Russian state."
