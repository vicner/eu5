 flavor_kni_pap.1.desc: "The widespread [crusade_target.GetCulture.GetName] piracy, with the [crusade_target.GetLongName] at its helm, has caused much dismay to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGroup.GetAdjective] shipping. Such a state of matters cannot stand. Christendom will not be humiliated by lowly [crusade_target.GetReligion.GetAdjective] pirates! To curb this misery, we could call a crusade on [crusade_target.GetNameWithNoTooltip], to end their treachery once and for all."
 flavor_kni_pap.1.historical_info: "The two Smyrniote Crusades took place between 1343 and 1351. During the first crusade, the Christians managed to capture the Smyrniote citadel and port but failed to secure the acropolis. To celebrate the successes, a mass was held in the city during which the Turks swept in and massacred the praying leadership. After that, a second crusade was organized to help the struggling Christian side of the city."
