 flavor_hun.590.desc: "In the tumultuous years following the [GetCountry('TUR').GetAdjective] expansion into the [ShowRegionName('balkan_region')], many [ShowCultureName('serbian')] refugees fled their homeland, seeking safety and new opportunities within the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName]. Among these exiles were seasoned warriors, driven from their lands but not from their fighting spirit.

Lightly armored but highly mobile, they excelled in hit-and-run attacks, harassing enemy forces, and striking fear into the hearts of their opponents. Their effectiveness on the battlefield soon became evident, and their reputation as elite cavalry spread far and wide."
