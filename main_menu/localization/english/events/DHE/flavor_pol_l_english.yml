Sigismund was brought up by Jesuits and preferred their company. Religion was as important to him as politics and one of his great obsessions was to make Catholicism the state religion of Poland. This was perhaps the most impossible task for a man, even if king, to accomplish in Poland. The freedom of religion and the ideological principle of religious tolerance were the foundation of Polish society. Sigismund was strong-willed and stubborn, so he tried nevertheless. He of course had the whole country against him and failed.

Situated in the city of Braunsberg, it served as a center of Catholic learning and a strategic stronghold of the Counter-Reformation in Northern Europe. The college offered education in the humanities, philosophy, and theology, attracting students from across the Commonwealth and beyond.

As the first complete Polish translation of the Bible from the original Hebrew and Greek texts, it reflected both the linguistic ambitions and religious fervor of the Calvinist movement. More than a theological work, it was a cultural achievement that contributed to the development of Polish literary language.

That would change with the end of the Jagiellonian Dynasty, triggering the first election where Szlachta had to choose from various foreign nobles.

However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed in Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanisław Leszczyński elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Ivan Mazepa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded king escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled to Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian, and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish land around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles was killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. In the peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire."

The fall of the key border fortress Kamieniec Podolski was followed by the humiliating Peace of Buchach. In 1683, Sobieski led a relief army to Vienna, besieged by the Ottomans, and as supreme commander of the allied forces won a resounding victory that marked the beginning of Ottoman withdrawal from Europe."
