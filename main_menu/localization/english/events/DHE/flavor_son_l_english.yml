The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] are already threatening that unless [target_character.GetSheHe] adapts to the requirements of the [ShowReligionGroupAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('muslim')] faith, they will seek a new ruler who does."

 flavor_son.3.historical_info: "The most important chronicle of the Songhai Empire, $tarikh_al_sudan$, was written around 1655 by 'Abd al-Raḥmān al-Sa'dī.

flavor_son.4.title: "Corp of Warriors"
flavor_son.4.desc: "Although [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has proven to be capable of defending itself from any external threats, the militarism within the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] has allowed new ideas to rise. One of them is that of a professional army, re-organizing the provinces in a manner that would make it much easier to distribute our manpower all around the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. [target_character.GetName] has overseen this project, already having found a small army of full-time warriors, [target_character.GetSheHe] may be able to create a standing army to dominate the rest of [ShowRegionName('guinea_region')]."
flavor_son.4.historical_info: "During the reign of Muḥammad Askia 'the Great', the Songhai army was reorganized, creating a distinction between a soldier and a peasant.

flavor_son.5.historical_info: "The reign of Askia 'the Great' is regarded as the start of the Songhai Empire.
