It was a war not just between kings, but lesser nobles were also able to pursue their agendas while participating in the larger conflict. Future wars saw far less factionalism, at least on the scale of medieval conflicts. The Hundred Years War was dozens of little wars and hundreds of battles and sieges that lasted for over a century, between 1337 and 1453, until both sides were exhausted.

Mary's Catholic claim to the throne posed a threat, so Elizabeth imprisoned her. Mary then became the focus of plots to overthrow Elizabeth, including a marriage proposal to Norfolk, England's only Duke. Norfolk's delay led to his imprisonment, yet Elizabeth suspected other nobles, like the Earls of Northumberland, Westmorland, and Cumberland, of involvement. When summoned to London, they rebelled on November 9, 1569. The uprising, fueled by resentment against Tudor rule, led to harsh measures from Elizabeth, including executions. Despite this, Catholicism persisted in the North, leading to a decade of persecution."

The southern army marched south to raise Lancashire instead of turning on the Duke of Argyll's flank, while a much smaller force under the Duke defeated the larger northern army of the Jacobites at Sheriffmuir on November 13th.
