 flavor_swe_teu.1.historical_info: "Klaus Störtebeker was a legendary German pirate in the late 14th century, known for raiding Hanseatic League ships. He led the Vitalienbrüder, a pirate group originally hired as privateers by Dukes of Mecklenburg against Queen Margaret but later turned against their employers. Captured in 1401 near Heligoland, he and his crew were executed in Hamburg. According to legend, he struck a deal: those he could walk past after beheading would be spared. Supposedly, he managed to pass several of his crewmates before the executioner tripped him ignoring the bargain. His name, meaning '#italic empty the mug in one gulp#!' reflects his notorious drinking ability."
