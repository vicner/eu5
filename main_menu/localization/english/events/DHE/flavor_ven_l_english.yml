 flavor_ven.1.desc: "For many centuries, the Commune of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] - and with it the Council of Forty - has served the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] as the supreme body of government while also turning the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] increasingly more into a figurehead for the nation. Naturally, this development was at odds with the elected rulers who intended to have a significant role in the domestic politics of the state.\n\nAs new reforms find their way in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] bureaucracy, the old Commune, as well as the Council of Forty, have found themselves in a position of obsoletion. Many duties of the council have been relegated to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName], and the commune is no longer adequate to sustain the growing bureaucratic demands of the state. The time has come to replace both institutions entirely with a new governmental body, which also gets the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] more actively involved in the domestic politics."

The State charged itself to discover heretics, who when caught were examined by the Patriarch, the Bishop of Castello, or any other [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] Ordinary. The examining Court was confined to a return of fact. It was called on to state whether the examinee was or was not guilty of heresy. Punishment was reserved for the secular authority. This arrangement did not satisfy the Court of [ShowLocationName('rome')], an Inquisitor was appointed by the [GetCountry('PAP').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], but he required the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s exequatur before he could act and a board was created of three [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] nobles, to sit as assessors to the Holy Office. Their duty was to guard the rights of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] citizens against ecclesiastical encroachment, including the non-interference in religious matters within the colonies, without their presence and their sanction no act of the Holy Office was valid in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip]. The Inquisition in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] was certainly no sanguinary Office, thanks no doubt in a large degree to the independent attitude of the State, which insisted upon the presence of lay assessors at every trial."

The renewal of the Rialto bridge was first proposed in 1503, and the idea was to rebuild the bridge in stone. The authorities requested proposals in 1551 after several projects had been considered since 1503 and the following decades. Famous architects such as Jacopo Sansovino, Palladio and Vignola offered plans, but their proposals were deemed inappropriate to the situation as they all involved a Classical approach with several arches. The famous artist Michelangelo was also considered as designer of the Rialto bridge, but the submission by Antonio da Ponte eventually defeated others, thanks to its audacious single-span design.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
