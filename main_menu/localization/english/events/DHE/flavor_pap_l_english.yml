The first recorded efforts to drain them date back to Pope Boniface VIII in 1298, whose canal project inadvertently led to further flooding. Throughout the following centuries, Popes including Eugene IV, Leo X, Martin V, Sixtus V, and Pius VI all attempted reclamation efforts, often encountering resistance from local nobility over property and fishing rights."
