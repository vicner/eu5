 flavor_swi.1.a: "What a brilliant man!"
 flavor_swi.1.b: "That does not sound useful at all."
 flavor_swi.1.historical_info: "Matthäus Schirner, bishop of Sitten since 1499, was the main instigator of the pro-papal policies in the Swiss Confederation during the War of the Holy League. Due to his involvement, Swiss troops were provided to the Pope permanently and he secured the ownership of Bellinzona for the Confederacy."

 flavor_swi.2.a: "Only practice makes perfect!"
 flavor_swi.2.b: "His attitude has no place here."
 flavor_swi.2.historical_info: "Theophrastus von Hohenheim, later renaming himself Paracelsus, was a physician and philosopher who spent most of his life in pursuit of universal knowledge. In 1527 and 1528 he spent his time in Basel, both as a physician and a teacher at the University of Basel. He was forced to leave the city, after disagreements about his teachings, which he held in German language and not in the usual Latin, and insulting judges during a trial. After leaving Basel, he continued his studies in Nürnberg, Merano, Augsburg, and Salzberg where he eventually succumbed to mercury poisoning in 1541."

 flavor_swi.110.historical_info: "Similar to many other parts of Europe, so was Switzerland severely affected by the Reformation as several cantons embraced its ideas while others maintained a pro-Catholic stance.

 flavor_swi.111.historical_info: "The Wars of Kappel was a series of two armed conflicts near Kappel am Albis between Catholic and Protestant cantons. The first war (1529) was triggered by the increasing influence of Huldrych Zwingli and led to the foundation of the Christian Union, while the second war (1531) was caused by the refusal of the Catholics to aid the Protestant cantons in the Musso War against the Duchy of Milan.

 flavor_swi.999.historical_info: "Historically, a movement for unification never existed for the Swiss Confederation per se. Instead, Switzerland always was a loose alliance of self-governing cantons until the French invasion of Switzerland in 1798 during the French Revolutionary Wars. While the resulting Helvetic Republic and the succeeding Restored Swiss Confederation still held onto the principles of self-governing cantons, the republic was on an external level barely different from any other nation-state. With the creation of the federal constitution on the 12th of September 1848, the Swiss alliance of city-states gave birth to the first proper state of Switzerland."

Following a coup orchestrated by the nobles and guild members of Zürich on the 7th of June 1336, Rudolf Brun was elected as the first mayor of the city. Directly after, Brun implemented the Guild Constitution, which reformed and reorganized the City Council with a balance of 26 members, 13 from the old elite of merchants and 13 from the previously excluded guilds."

 flavor_swi.1001.historical_info: "After the Guild Revolution of 1336, 22 of the previous Council Members fled Zürich to the nearby, Habsburg-controlled, town of Rapperswil. From there, they undertook efforts to destabilize the government of Rudolf Brun in Zürich. These efforts culminated in the night of the 24th of February 1350, the so-called Murder Night of Zürich. When the Conspirators entered the city, let in by sympathizers from within Zürich, they met fierce opposition from Brun and the guilds, who had been informed about the plot before.
