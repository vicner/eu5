Their traditional sources of income dwindled, and the financial burdens of maintaining a fleet to patrol the Mediterranean grew heavier. In response, many turned to privateering, raiding Muslim merchant ships under the guise of defending Christendom. Over time, some knights took this further, embracing piracy as a way of life, living in luxury off their plunder, and even joining the navies of France and Spain in search of wealth and adventure."

 flavor_kni.17.d: "Its harbor will flourish under our rule!"
 flavor_kni.17.historical_info: "The Knights gained control of Tripoli in 1530 when Emperor Charles V granted them the city alongside Malta and Gozo. However, their rule over Tripoli was fraught with difficulties. The city was isolated, poorly defended, and surrounded by hostile forces. The Order struggled to maintain control, facing frequent raids and uprisings.
