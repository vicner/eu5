 flavor_tim.6.title: "[target_timur.GetNameWithNoTooltip] the Lame"
 flavor_tim.6.desc: "It seems that [target_timur.GetName] has not completely left behind the foolish days of his youth. As he did when he was younger, he tends to group with some like-minded individuals and commit some pillaging on their own. However, in one of his recent escapades to steal some sheep from a local shepherd, he was caught in the act and shot by two arrows, injuring him in his right leg and making him lose two fingers of his right hand.\n\nAlthough fortunately not fatal, these injuries will accompany him forever, making him a cripple for life. As a result, some people have already started calling him [target_timur.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] #italic Lang#!, or [target_timur.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] the Lame, due to his limping."

 flavor_tim.7.b: "It will just be a waste of money."
 flavor_tim.7.historical_info: "As the founder of the Timurid dynasty, the life and expansion of power of Timur attracted much interest.

Now that much of our power base lies within the [ShowCultureGroupName('iranian_group')] people, it is time for perhaps a change of rulership. [target_character2.GetName] has been planning on restructuring the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] to a more bureaucratic state, assigning [target_character.GetHerHis] descendants as governors, hoping to grant them the experience to rule. In addition, this would require us to merge with [ShowCultureGroupNameWithNoTooltip('iranian_group')] administration, something that may upset our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCulture.GetName] elite."
 flavor_tim.9.historical_info: "At the peak of the Timurid Empire, much of Iran was under their rule. Despite that, the Timurid law was more akin to that of the Mongol states rather than the $sharia$ of previous rulers in the region.

This included empowering the $sharia$ courts over the Mongol tribunals."
 flavor_tim.9.a: "We aim to rule, not to conquer."
 flavor_tim.9.b: "We will not abandon our old traditions."

 timurid_renaissance_historical_info: "Due to Timur's conquests, there was an influx of artisans from the numerous cities he looted.

 flavor_tim.12.historical_info: "The 'Tamerlane Chess' variant is a more complex, and more strategic variant of chess. It has three starting formations, the masculine, the feminine, and the third array, whilst containing different pieces such as the vizier, elephant, and war engine.

 flavor_tim.13.historical_info: "Whilst both the $sharia$ and the Mongol Law were present in the Timurid Empire during the reign of Timur, the latter dominated the administration. Its secrecy and arbitrary laws allowed for tyrannical practices to be developed. It is for that reason that in 1411 Shāh Rukh abolished the Yarghu Tribunal from every corner of the Empire, and instead replaced them with the $sharia$."
 flavor_tim.13.a: "Let us implement the [ShowPolicyNameWithNoTooltip('sharia_law_policy')]."

Perhaps it is time for us to move to [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 flavor_tim.14.historical_info: "Although the glory days of Herat were gone, the sons of Timur wished to elevate the city, making it the center of the Empire.

 flavor_tim.18.historical_info: "During the height of Shāh Rukh's reign over the Timurids, there were two languages that were predominant over the people and the court, those being the Persian and Chagatai ones. Although he favored the Persian culture, ignoring his elites, the Chagatai literature saw a flourishment as well. One of these writers was Niẓām al-Dīn 'Alī Shīr Herawī, the greatest representative of the literature.
