 flavor_brapru.1.title: "The End of the Twin Towns of Berlin and Kölln"
 flavor_brapru.1.desc: "The river Spree has acted as the border between Kölln and Berlin since their foundation, but the #italic Mühlendamm#!, a dam that cuts the Spree in two, has acted as the bond that has united the #italic Twin Cities#! forever. Acting as conjoined twins, the two cities have always covered each other backs and acted as a front, opposing the power of the rulers of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. Despite many rulers trying to enforce their power over them, they have stubbornly resisted any attempt to submit them. Now, [target_character.GetName] has the means to enforce this union and stop the liberties of the two cities, converting the merged city into a proper capital for our nation."

 flavor_brapru.1.historical_info: "In 1307, Berlin and Kölln formed an alliance with other towns in the Margraviate such as Brandenburg an der Havel, Frankfurt an der Oder, and Salzwedel. This alliance was forged to collectively defend their rights against the sovereign of the time, Heinrich I. However, the autonomy of Kölln and Berlin was brought to an end by Elector Frederick II Irontooth of Brandenburg in 1451, as he declared the twin town to be his official residence.\n\nIn 1710, under the decree of King Frederick I, the twin cities Kölln and old Berlin were merged. The result of this merger was the establishment of the capital of Prussia. Notably, Altberlin's substantial size, being twice that of Kölln, made the new city be named Berlin."

The Gate, designed in the style of neoclassicism, was built at the then borders of the City of Berlin, in the zone of Dorotheenstadt to commemorate the Prussian victory against a Dutch popular revolt and the formation of an alliance with the countries of the Netherlands and Great Britain."

 flavor_brapru.5.historical_info: "With the Ascension of Friedrich Wilhelm to the Prussian throne, the country entered a new era. He radically reformed the State Budget, cutting the expanses for the court to almost nothing, while heavily investing in the expansion of the army and administration of the state. While the army of Prussia grew to 80000 men, he reduced the courtly positions to a third of previous positions in order to save costs and reduce the debt Prussia had accumulated under his father's rule. His reforms transformed Prussia into an absolute and militaristic state that would ascend to the status of major power during the 18th century. "
