 flavor_chi.1.desc: "Although it is undeniable that we are the center of the world, and anything outside our borders is not really worthy of our attention, knowledge of those far-away places is nonetheless useful. As such, we have had [target_explorer.GetName] bring us information about such places, and [target_explorer.GetSheHe] is conducting explorations for us.\n\nHowever, many at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] argue that it is not worthy of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] to worry about barbarian lands, while others have the opposite opinion and suggest that we should instead further direct our gaze outwards, as they foresee many benefits from it."
 flavor_chi.1.historical_info: "In the 14th century, China's relations with the outside world began to change. Under the Yuán Dynasty, China had made contact with the West by reopening the old silk routes and bringing Muslim, Christian, and Jewish traders into China. The expulsion of the Mongols in 1367 and the seizure of power by the Míng reversed the processes that were tying China more strongly to the outside. Following the seven expeditions (1405-1433) of admiral Zhèng Hé, who sailed the imperial fleet into the Indian Ocean and to the coast of Africa, China folded in on itself and closed off its external connections."

One problem is the sorry state of the [ShowBuildingTypeName('ruined_great_wall_of_china')], built in ancient times, but left to crumble in recent centuries. We could repair it, but it would be expensive and the effort, both physical and fiscal, would likely cause some unrest among the people. However, with improved defenses, the provinces in the area would likely become more productive and secure, while without them, people may leave for safer havens. What shall we do?"
 flavor_chi.2.a: "Let us maintain the [ShowBuildingTypeNameWithNoTooltip('ruined_great_wall_of_china')] better."
 flavor_chi.2.b: "We could repair extensively the section in [target_province1.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."

 flavor_chi.4.desc: "The noted [target_character.GetName] has proposed a series of military reforms which, if implemented, would make our armies stronger and our men fight more effectively. Unfortunately, a thorough overhaul of the military is quite an undertaking. It will take quite a bit of money and effort, and even then the armed forces may not appreciate the changes, leading to instability and desertions."

Although their strange beliefs, which they call [target_country.GetReligion.GetName], may subvert our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] teachings if allowed to spread through our lands, it is undeniable that the knowledge they bring may be greatly beneficial for us.\n\nSome among our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] argue that we should use any advantage we can get from them, even if at the cost of some people being deceived by this foreign religion. However, others fear for the integrity of our institutions if we allow such barbarian ideas to permeate our society."
 flavor_chi.5.historical_info: "In 1581, the first Jesuit missionaries arrived in China, bringing gifts to the Emperor and exhibiting various mechanical inventions from Europe. They also exhibited great knowledge by creating a huge map of the world and proposing sound ideas for a new calendar reform. But they also brought with them strange religious and philosophical ideas, which started to disrupt the traditional order of China."

 flavor_chi.6.desc: "Due to decades of rebellions, unrest, and corruption, our financial situation is in dire straits. We need a new inflow of cash, but the only way to do so is to institute new unpopular taxes. By doing so, we can temporarily relieve some of our cash flow problems, but the already unstable situation may become even worse. But if we do not, we may lose the ability to raise taxes efficiently in certain provinces due to the unrest."

 flavor_chi.7.title: "The Expulsion of the Jesuits"
 flavor_chi.7.desc: "Due to recent events, it now seems that the Jesuits may have outlived their usefulness. Although their knowledge is great, it is foreign to us and sometimes causes much commotion among our scholars and the common folk, disrupting the stability of our realm. They have been for decades interfering in the internal affairs of our nation, even trying to meddle in the affairs of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] succession. Perhaps it is time for them to go."

This does mean that [target_character.GetSheHe] has had a lot more success than many of [target_character.GetHerHis] brethren when it comes to attracting converts, but [target_character.GetHerHis] skills, especially relating to astronomy and cartography, could undoubtedly come of use to us."

The Jesuits have become convinced that the way to approach the [ShowCultureGroupNameWithNoTooltip('chinese_group')] people is by learning to act and fit in among them.\n\nIt comes as no surprise to us that these foreigners would like to emulate us, but it is possible this will make their preaching reach a larger part of our population."

However, [target_character.GetSheHe] could never gain the primacy in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] due to the scandal that would inevitably erupt, were [target_character.GetSheHe] elevated to the status of a primary consort. Now, with the death of [deceased_wife.GetName], the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has been given the most favorable time to elevate [target_character.GetHerHim] to the status of Empress Consort."
