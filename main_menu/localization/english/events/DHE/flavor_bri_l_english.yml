 flavor_bri.1.desc: "In 1464, Jehan Lagadeuc wrote the first trilingual dictionary, which contained words in Latin, Breton, and French. This amazing book was the first dictionary in either the Breton or the French language. By distributing copies of the Catholicon, we can show that Breton is just as much a major language as French."
 flavor_bri.1.a: "Good for Brittany!"
