Instead, [target_character.GetSheHe] wishes to create [target_character.GetHerHis] own one. This school would be closer to a new religion, where all sects are considered as one. Called [ShowReligiousSchoolName('din_i_ilahi_school')], its purpose is to unite the people residing in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."

 flavor_mug.2.desc: "The current taxation system has become complicated with all of the different regional laws we have integrated from our conquests.

It is meant to properly organize the taxation of non-[ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetGroup.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] rather than abide to their local laws."
 flavor_mug.2.historical_info: "The chaotic and disorganized taxation system during the reign of Akbar resulted in lots of land revenue being lost for the Mughals. It was for that reason that the finance minister at the time, Raja Todar Mal, decided to reform them all into a more streamlined system, the Dahsala. There were three ways that a region was taxed. The Zabiti, Nasaq, and Galla-Bakshi."

 flavor_mug.3.title: "Organizing the Sūbah"
 flavor_mug.3.desc: "Due to the current size of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], it is not feasible to rule it all from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. For that reason, a new way of organizing these places has been proposed, that being the [ShowGovernmentReformName('subah_organization_reform')] system, meant to grant governorship to any prominent member of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
 flavor_mug.3.a: "Ensuring that all the Sūbah are under control is our priority."
 flavor_mug.3.b: "All of our regions are fine already."

 flavor_mug.4.desc: "In order to ensure the financial stability of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], as well as reduce any inflation problems that our economy may be facing, [target_character.GetName] has proposed minting a new coin. Using the vast supplies of [ShowGoodsName('goods_gold')] and [ShowGoodsName('silver')], it will allow us to mint multiple variants of these coins.

 flavor_mug.5.title: "Protecting Land Trade"
 flavor_mug.5.desc: "Banditry has been rampant within trade routes in [ShowRegionName('hindustan_region')], with merchants frequently reporting losing their goods when their caravans pass through these lands.

 flavor_mug.5.historical_info: "Due to the banditry of Hindustan during the 16th century, many of the roads were unprotected.

Calling it the $taj_mahal$, it is planned to be built from ivory-white marble, and where [target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will rest eternally."

 flavor_mug.7.desc: "The military organization within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] for a long time has not been one where merit is favored, but rather the amount of lands they possess. Instead, there should be a more fair system, where the merits and positions is what determines the amount of land and wealth one receives. This would surely upset the balance of power within the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], but it is bound to massively improve our land forces."
 flavor_mug.7.a: "Let us implement this system."

One of them is Fatehpur Sikrī, which has caught the attention of [target_character.GetName], wishing to transform it into the center of [ShowRegionName('hindustan_region')]. Whilst this will be helpful, it would also be costly."
flavor_mug.12.historical_info: "Founded in 1571 as the new capital of the Mughal Empire, Fatehpur Sikri received great attention from Emperor Akbar, who sought refuge from the busyness of Agra. He oversaw the construction of new gardens, temples, and commercial centers, transforming the city into a vibrant hub.
