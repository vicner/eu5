 flavor_vol.1.title: "To Rule a Foreign Country"
 flavor_vol.1.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName] has the difficult task of ruling over a country where very few people share [target_ruler.GetHerHis] faith. To alleviate the issues arising from this, we could invite some [ShowReligionAdjective('catholic')] advisors from the [ShowCultureGroupName('slavic_group')] areas of [ShowContinentName('europe')] which already follow the [ShowReligionAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('catholic')] faith."
 flavor_vol.1.historical_info: "King Yuri II of Ruthenia was member of the Polish Piast dynasty, and through his mother he was descendant also of the Rurik dynasty, as she was the sister of Lev II of Galicia. After Lev II, the throne of Ruthenia passed on to Yuri II, who was nonetheless a foreigner and a Catholic. This made him generally unpopular with the Orthodox people of Ruthenia, and would ultimately led to his assassination in 1340."
 flavor_vol.1.a: "We need their help to shape the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
 flavor_vol.1.b: "We can not risk the anger of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')]."

 flavor_vol.2.title: "A Connection to the West"
 flavor_vol.2.desc: "[ShowLocationName('sanok')] at the feet of the Carpathian Mountains occupies an important area of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. Plenty of merchants coming from and traveling towards [ShowLocationName('krakow')] and [ShowAreaName('slovakia_area')] stop in [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('sanok')] conducting trade with our local population. With some investment, [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('sanok')] could develop into an important trade hub for both our own and foreign merchants."
 flavor_vol.2.a: "Invest in a new center for our merchants!"
 flavor_vol.2.b: "This is not worth the money."

 flavor_vol.3.title: "The Potential of [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_vol.3.desc: "At the center of [ShowAreaName('red_ruthenia_area')] lies [target_location.GetName], a [target_location.GetRank.GetName] well suited to serve us as a center for our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. Unfortunately, the local population is lacking in funds to improve the conditions. We could raise the attractiveness of [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip] under the privileges granted by the [ShowEstatePrivilegeName('novi_fori')] and some additional investment from ourselves."
 flavor_vol.3.a: "[target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will prosper."
 flavor_vol.3.b: "A foolish waste of money."
 flavor_vol.3.c: "Our Capital shall grow to new heights."

 flavor_vol.4.title: "A Resurfaced Chronicle"
 flavor_vol.4.desc: "One member of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')], [target_character.GetName], has made an interesting discovery while working in a monastery. During his work, he unveiled a codex written in [ShowLanguageName('church_slavonic_language')] that consists in a compendium of different chronicles recording and retelling the history of the old Kievan Rus' from the times of [GetCharacter('kie_rurik').GetName] and even before him.\n\nWe should summon [target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip] together with his discovery to our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] at once and make sure that this historic documentation of the [ShowCultureName('ruthenian')] people can endure for centuries."
 flavor_vol.4.a: "A fascinating tale of bygone years."
 flavor_vol.4.b: "This does not sound believable."

 flavor_vol.1000.title: "The Succession of [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_vol.1000.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and [target_ruler.GetName] are facing an uncertain future due to the lack of an heir and an unstable political situation. Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] demand that one of their own will be designated as a candidate, as long as [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] does not have a son of [target_ruler.GetHisHer] own. With the additional pressure [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] faces from both [GetCountry('POL').GetName] and [GetCountry('LIT').GetName], this seems like an unsolvable situation to navigate without incurring the wrath of at least one party."
 flavor_vol.1000.historical_info: "A member of the Polish Piast dynasty, King Yuri II of Ruthenia also married the daughter of the Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas, who was also the sister of the wife of Kazimierz III of Poland. In 1338, Yuri offered the succession to the throne of Galicia to Kazimierz, but Lithuania also having claims on it sparked the Galicia-Volhynia Wars after Yuri's murder in 1340."
 flavor_vol.1000.a: "[GetCharacter('pol_casimir_iii_piast').GetNameWithNoTooltip] will be our candidate."

 flavor_vol.1001.title: "An Heir for [target_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_vol.1001.desc: "The [target_country.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] of [target_country.GetName] have convinced [target_ruler.GetName] to proclaim [target_heir.GetName] as [target_ruler.GetHisHer] candidate to succession. With our family connection to [target_ruler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip], we expected to gain significant influence in the [target_country.GetFlavorRank] with [target_ruler.GetHerHis] death, expectations now ruined by this turn of events. If [target_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip] denies us our right to inherit, we shall take it by force."
 flavor_vol.1001.a: "Prepare the army!"

 flavor_vol.1002.title: "The Religion of [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_vol.1002.desc: "Our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] remains very concerned about the religious practices of [target_ruler.GetName]. With the preference he has shown to foreign [ShowReligionAdjective('catholic')] influences, the [ShowReligionAdjective('orthodox')] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] are concerned that [target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] has ambitions to spread the [ShowReligionAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('catholic')] faith in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Publicly converting to [ShowReligionNameWithNoTooltip('orthodox')] would appease them, but it would also hurt our relations with our [ShowReligionAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('catholic')] neighbors."
 flavor_vol.1002.historical_info: "A Catholic in an Orthodox realm, King Yuri II of Ruthenia frequently me with opposition with the Galician nobility and clergy, especially when he made attempts to introduce Catholicism into the kingdom. This would in the end lead to some of the boyars being openly discontent with him, and to his assassination in the end."
 flavor_vol.1002.a: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will not bow to these petty demands."
 flavor_vol.1002.b: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will convert to [ShowReligionNameWithNoTooltip('orthodox')]."

 flavor_vol.1003.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName] has angered the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] greatly with [target_ruler.GetHisHer] choices and favoritism towards [ShowReligionAdjective('catholic')] voices. In a desperate attempt to regain some favors of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')], we could extend their privileges and hope this smoothes our relations with them."
 flavor_vol.1003.a: "Grant them more privileges."
 flavor_vol.1003.b: "This is impossible!"

 flavor_vol.1100.title: "Poisoning of [pol_the_dead_monarch.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_vol.1100.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] family mourns as [pol_the_dead_monarch.GetName] is declared dead by [pol_the_dead_monarch.GetHisHer] court physician. One would expect the courtiers to be engulfed in tears as well, but that is not the case. The harsh truth is that such an outcome was rather expected, as the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] had been displeased with [pol_the_dead_monarch.GetHimHer] for a long while due to [pol_the_dead_monarch.GetHisHer] foreign lineage and [pol_the_dead_monarch.GetHisHer] open preference of [ShowReligionAdjective('catholic')] advisors. As such, the verdict of poisoning seems far from surprising. More worrying than the death itself is the fate of our beloved [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName], and who will take its reins now."
 flavor_vol.1100.historical_info: "The poisoning of Yuri II of Ruthenia sparked the Galicia-Volhynia Wars between Poland and Lithuania, with the support of Hungary and the Golden Horde respectively, and various Ruthenian factions fighting for both sides. The wars lasted for half a century, from 1340 to 1392, and ended up with Galicia-Volhynia being partitioned between Poland and Lithuania."
 flavor_vol.1100.a: "[GetCharacter('pol_casimir_iii_piast').GetNameWithNoTooltip] is the legal heir."
