[GetCountry('ETH').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has sent an ambassador named [scope_mattheus.GetName]. [scope_mattheus.GetNameWithNoTooltip] is a Christian, albeit of a kind we have never seen before, and begs us to restore his master's rightful dominions, but [GetCountry('MAM').GetAdjective] power is still threatening and it seems to be a big risk for questionable gain.

Instead, the royal court travels from chief to chief every few months.\n\nWhile it is hard to establish an administrative continuity under such circumstances, the traveling court does have its benefits.

As a fellow realm under the Patriarchate of [ShowLocationName('alexandria')], it is our duty to act.

The message is a detailed account of the many perceived misdeeds of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] against the [ShowReligionAdjective('miaphysite')] people that reside within our borders.\n\nThere is likely little reason for concern, however, as the patriarch of both the [ShowReligionAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('miaphysite')] people in [ShowRegionName('egypt_region')] and [ShowRegionName('ethiopia_region')] is our hostage.

The [target_mam.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has chosen to show [target_mam_ruler.GetHerHis] contempt for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] and [target_mam_ruler.GetSheHe] ridicules any form of retribution that we might attempt."

 flavor_eth.100.title: "The Monastic Orders"
 flavor_eth.100.desc: "One of the greatest strengths of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Church is the great number of successful monasteries that dot the landscape of our state. The Monastic orders have contributed to the success of our state by founding new monasteries in newly conquered areas and by spreading the word of the true faith there. The monasteries of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] are also the source of the education of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')], its [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')], and its administrators, and as such have contributed greatly to the revitalization of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] Church in the years past.\n\nThe other side of this coin, however, is that the monasteries and the orders that run them have grown both rich and autonomous."

Perhaps there was once a practical need for bishops, clergy, and spiritual guidance from abroad, but the expansion of the [ROOT.GetFlavorRank] Church over the last centuries, however, means that our [ShowCountryRankName('ETH')] is now already training its [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] and there is a strong religious infrastructure in the form of churches and monasteries throughout our lands.\n\nWith the Egyptian Patriarchate held hostage by [ShowReligionName('muslim')] conquerors, we often have to wait a long time between the death of one bishop and the appointment of the next. It would be far more efficient to appoint our religious leadership from the ranks of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')]."

Priests often use the cross to bless or heal believers by gently rubbing it against them.\n\nCrafted from a single piece of metal, it is made of bronze and gold with its central cross featuring an elongated descending arm and gracefully flared ends, all adorned with intricate ornamentation.

He drew his laws from apostolic writings and previous law codes of Byzantine rulers.\n\nThe textual history of the #italic Fetha Negest#! reveals its two distinct parts. The first part primarily focuses on ecclesiastical matters, detailing the structure of the Church hierarchy and sacraments. It incorporates elements from the Bible, works of early Church fathers like St. Basil and St. Hippolytus, as well as canons established at councils such as the Council of Nicaea and the Council of Antioch.\n\nThe second part of the #italic Fetha Negest#! addresses issues pertaining to the laity, including family law, debt, and civil administration. While drawing from the same sources as the first part, it is largely attributed to four books collectively known as the #italic Canons of the Emperors#!. These books include the #italic Procheiron#! (also known as #italic Procheiros Nomos#!), the Arabic version of the #italic Syro-Roman Law Book#!, the Arabic version of the #italic Ecloga#!, and the #italic Precepts of the Old Testament#!.\n\nFor centuries, the #italic Fetha Negest#! has served as an authoritative legal guide for the [ShowReligionAdjective('miaphysite')] Christians of [ShowRegionName('egypt_region')]. It has now been translated to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCulture.GetLanguage.GetName] in [ShowRegionName('ethiopia_region')] and expanded upon with additional local laws.
