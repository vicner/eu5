The Augsburg Interim primarily reflected a Catholic viewpoint; however, it did allow clerical marriage and communion in both kinds (bread and wine) for the laity. Several Protestant electors objected to the Catholic emphasis of the Augsburg Interim and refused to abide by it. Charles attempted to force its acceptance, an action that led the Protestants to adopt the Leipzig Interim, which upheld Protestant doctrines, at a subsequent Diet. Neither Interim was fully accepted so a German religious settlement was not brought about until the Peace of Augsburg in 1555, which established the principle #italic Cuius regio, eius religio#!, 'whose realm, their religion', dictating that the religion of each ruler would then be enforced for their subjects."

 flavor_hab.2400.desc: "It has been nearly a generation since [rudolf.GetName] became the first [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] ruler of [GetCountry('BOH').GetName]. Yet, his untimely passing in 1307 without an heir saw us lose our grip on the [GetCountry('BOH').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] throne. Though an armed takeover of [GetCountry('BOH').GetNameWithNoTooltip] is unthinkable in the current climate, perhaps a more diplomatic approach could serve our ambitions. A marriage alliance with one of the [bohemian_ruler.GetName]'s daughters could provide a pathway toward renewing our claim to the throne.

The Austrians speak of reconciliation, proposing that such a union would restore peace and stability between our realms after years of mistrust. However, many at our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] suspect their true aim is to regain influence over [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], potentially even laying the groundwork for their dynastic ambitions. Supporters of the proposal argue that a strong alliance with [GetCountry('HAB').GetNameWithNoTooltip] could shield [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] from outside threats, while detractors warn that it could lead to [GetCountry('HAB').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] domination of our realm."

# flavor_hab.21.title: "Peasant Revolt in Austria"
# flavor_hab.21.desc: "The 1620s were characterized by long and cold winters, late springs and cold and wet summers, leading to crop-failure and sharp increases in grain prices. Into this atmosphere of enhanced tension broke a climatic event of unusual severity. In 1626, during the last week of May, in the middle of the vegetation period, winter returned. The temperature fell so that lakes and rivers froze and trees shed their leaves. The unexpected return of winter caused panic and anxiety among the peasants who could not remember ever experiencing such destruction of their fields. This event, combined with the brutal persecution of Protestants, led the mainly Protestant peasants of Upper Austria, pledged to Bavaria, to revolt. The peasants were defeated after heavy fighting, and in 1628 the country passed into the hands of the emperor again."

# flavor_hab.22.title: "Noble Revolt in Hungary"
# flavor_hab.22.desc: "As struggles came and went the ruling family of Hungary, the Habsburgs, had established the following pattern in treating their nobility. During times of foreign war, nobles were granted rights which the crown then tried to recall as soon as peace came. This, naturally, often triggered revolts. Following this pattern, taxes and military drafts were imposed upon the nobles after Hungary's decisive victory over the Turks in 1699. But, when Austria went to war with France in 1703, the nobles revolted once again, and forced the Emperor Charles V to restore the old system of noble privileges, in the Peace of Szatmar of 1711."
