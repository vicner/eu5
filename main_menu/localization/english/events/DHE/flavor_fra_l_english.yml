 flavor_fra.5.historical_info: "Armand Jean du Plessis, commonly known as Cardinal de Richelieu, was 39 years old when he became Chief Minister of King Louis XIII in 1624. His main successful efforts in domestic policy were the fight against the upper nobility and the Protestant political privileges. He also supported overseas trade, colonial expansion and the constitution of a permanent royal navy. The most notable achievement remained the diplomatic game he played during the Thirty Years War, pushing with French gold the Swedish intervention in 1630 and ultimately with France joining the war in 1635. His aims had been the reduction of the House of Habsburg and the extrication of France from encirclement by enemy lands. He is considered as the inventor of the concept of Real Politik."

 flavor_fra.7.historical_info: "The Fronde (1648-1653) was mostly the last revolt of the French nobility against royal absolutism. It had started by the revolt of the Parliament of Paris (at the time the highest French court with jurisdiction over royal edicts) against the domestic policies of Cardinal Mazarin, who acted as Prime Minister of the 5-year-old Louis XIV. It was followed by that of the upper nobility, but the rebellion was finally suppressed by a combination of Machiavellian diplomacy, betrayals and reverses of fortune. The Parliament was muzzled (it would not be convened again before 1789) and the upper nobility deprived of political power, preparing the advent of total royal absolutism under the Sun King, Louis XIV, after 1661."

 flavor_fra.8.historical_info: "Cardinal de Richelieu, being a liberal patron of literature, created the l'Academie Française in 1636 in order to promote French language and literary pursuits.

 flavor_fra.9.historical_info: "Nominated Minister of Finance in 1661, Jean Colbert developed the first national economy of the modern age. His state-guided economy included better tax collection, statistical planning of the budget and regular bookkeeping. An advocate of his own brand of Mercantilism (referred to as Colbertism), he aimed at a favorable French balance of trade through the export of valuable finished products and high import tariffs. He encouraged a more efficient domestic trade, established state monopolies, subsidized manufactures, promoted navigation and trade associations, fixed agricultural prices, and encouraged marriage while prohibiting emigration (except to Canada). To support his policies, he also greatly enlarged the size of the Royal French navy. While Colbertism promoted commerce and crafts, thereby increasing prosperity, peasants were not stimulated to increase their production."

Tales from our forces have informed us that she claims to have been given a mission by God to stop our campaign in [GetCountry('FRA').GetName] and drive out our armies altogether. Such claims are potential grounds for a trial of heresy, it would only require the permission of the court, however, should she be found guilty and executed, her supporters in [GetCountry('FRA').GetNameWithNoTooltip] could become emboldened. We could also instead offer to ransom her return to the [GetCountry('FRA').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip], as their court would likely be willing to consider her release in exchange for a large sum of gold."

 flavor_fra.532.desc: "Seeking to update the infrastructure with the newfound state surplus, [target_character.GetName] has put forth an ambitious project to modernize and improve the roads of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] along with the means to establish a national road network. However, in order to achieve the ambitious proposal, [target_character.GetLastNameWithNoTooltip] has petitioned the use of forced labor, hoping to use the peasants of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] to carry out the construction of the roads in a timely manner. Given the hardships many members of the third estate have suffered in recent decades, conscripting them for such a project would no doubt worsen relations between the state and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')]. Some on the council, however, have found [target_character.GetLastNameWithNoTooltip]'s proposal promising and that the use of this forced labor would aid in achieving the project's goal."

 flavor_fra.533.desc: "Throughout his tenure, [target_character.GetName] has taken great efforts to improve the commercial trade of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], and thus far they have proven rather successful. From relocating funds from a militarized navy to focus more on maritime trade, trade between [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] and the rest of the world has seen a large increase. Along with the establishment of a national road project, not only has our maritime trade seen a beneficial increase, but intercontinental trade with our neighbors has also benefited, with more modern and efficient land routes."

 flavor_fra.534.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] shall continue without a chief minister for now."

Seeking to create a new generation of engineers, both military and civilian, the proposed school could be a breakthrough in the engineering efforts of the state. Such a proposal, however, will come at great expense for the state."

 flavor_fra.542.desc: "Following the implementation of [target_character.GetName]'s [ShowLawName('fra_5_percent_tax')], many of the local parliaments have issued opposition to the new tax, and have refused to carry out the decree in the provinces. While the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName] voiced opposition to the law initially, following the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]'s intervention into the process, many members folded into accepting [target_character.GetLastNameWithNoTooltip]'s tax.\n\nWhile the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] can take direct action in closing the local parliaments directly, forcing local officials to answer to the state directly, it will also greatly erode relations with the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] who have voiced criticism towards the new law."
 flavor_fra.542.a: "Close down the parliaments!"
 flavor_fra.542.b: "Retract the law."

 flavor_fra.543.desc: "While the Jesuit order in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has held strong for several centuries, in recent years, they have earned the ire of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetParliament.GetName], as well as the frustration of [fra_ruler.GetName]. While the Jesuits lead some of the most prominent and successful colleges in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip], their considerable influence has been a growing concern for [fra_ruler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip], seeing them as a threat due to their independence from the authority of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('crown_estate')].\n\nAllies in the Estates-General have put forth the idea of expelling the Jesuits for good from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip], and such a measure would likely pass. However, such a measure would also stir grievances in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] family, as several members, including [scope_heir_fra.GetName], are fierce supporters of the order."

While [scope_heir_fra.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] has professed [scope_heir_fra.GetHisHer] disagreement, [consort_fra.GetName] has also been rallying support across the council in hopes of overturning the law. While this issue will divide the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] household for the coming future, the Jesuits' influence within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] has already begun to decrease, with many Jesuits having already fled."
