 flavor_ayu.1.title: "The Founding of $ayutthaya$"
 flavor_ayu.1.desc: "Having brought together under [target_ruler.GetHerHis] rule the territories of [GetCountry('LAV').GetName] and [GetCountry('ADH').GetName], now [target_ruler.GetName] has set [target_ruler.GetHerHis] sight to greater heights. Using [target_ruler.GetHerHis] close ties to the people of [GetCountry('SPN').GetName], [target_ruler.GetSheHe] has brought forth a proposal to establish a new city in the land around [target_location.GetName], from where [target_ruler.GetSheHe] aims to rule all the territories as a unified country. The city, and this new nation, is to be called $ayutthaya$, giving it a distinct [ShowCultureName('thai_culture')] identity separated from the old [ShowLanguageName('sanskrit_language')] of [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 flavor_ayu.1.a: "The new city and country shall rise above all!"
 flavor_ayu.1.b: "Our identity is not defined by just a city."
 flavor_ayu.1.c: "The funds for it can better be used elsewhere."

 flavor_ayu.2.title: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s Reforms"
 flavor_ayu.2.desc: "Although our administration is certainly successful, [target_ruler.GetName] has noticed some gaps in it and has proposed various reforms in order to better streamline the government of the state. While many of these proposals make great sense, they will also be at the cost of upsetting, at least temporarily, the ways the wheels of our government work, and there are many who see these changes with skepticism."
 flavor_ayu.2.historical_info: "King Borommatrailokkanat introduced numerous reforms during his reign as King of Ayutthaya. Among those were the traditional Thai ministries #italic Kalahom#! and #italic Mahatthai#!, predecessors of nowadays ministry of defense and ministry of interior respectively. He also structured the feudal system and social hierarchy under the #italic Sakdina#!, and stabilized royal succession. Although the ministries had existed before, it was their reorganization and institutionalization by King Borommatrailokkanat in 1454 what turned them into the basis of Ayutthaya's government, and their structure remained in use until 1892."
 flavor_ayu.2.a: "Upgrades, people. Upgrades."
 flavor_ayu.2.b: "We should not change what is already working."

 flavor_ayu.3.title: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s Army Reforms"
 flavor_ayu.3.desc: "While our armies are the pride and joy of our country, there is always room from improvement. [target_ruler.GetName] has proposed various reforms for our military forces, including the training of a full-time professional elephant brigade. We certainly need to keep our army in their best fighting condition, but some doubt the actual effectiveness of these reforms in the field of battle."
 flavor_ayu.3.a: "The army needs constant drilling and improvement."
 flavor_ayu.3.b: "Let us focus on what is proved and tested."

 flavor_ayu.4.title: "[target_ruler.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s Economic Reforms"
 flavor_ayu.4.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName] has proposed various reforms concerning trade and the economic well-being of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. While trade through our country is already substantial, improving trade routes and the overall economy of our land may return in increased long-term benefits for our people."
 flavor_ayu.4.a: "The trade must flow."
 flavor_ayu.4.a.tt: "Many of our [locations|e] will gain [ShowNamedValue('development_weak_bonus')|+=] [development|e]"
 flavor_ayu.4.b: "Too much intervention could even upset trade."

 flavor_ayu.5.title: "The Foundation of the Modern [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCulture.GetNameWithNoTooltip] State"
 flavor_ayu.5.desc: "[target_ruler.GetName] is a remarkable ruler in our country's long history, as [target_ruler.GetHerHis] leadership is truly enlightened. [target_ruler.GetSheHe|U] wants [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to stand on equal footing with history's greatest empires, and has set [target_ruler.GetHerHis] eyes on placing the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] on a new course. [target_ruler.GetSheHe|U] wishes to refound the state by moving its capital a bit south from [target_location.GetName] and undertaking a thorough administrative reform."
 flavor_ayu.5.historical_info: "The fall of the Ayutthaya Kingdom was a turbulent time, marked by war and internal fragmentation. King Taksin, formerly a general under the Ayutthaya administration, led the liberation of Siam from the Burmese forces and then managed to unify Siam, which had been divided between several warlord forces. Taksin then established the Thonburi Kingdom, establishing a new city and capital in Bangkok, which also served as the capital of the following Rattanakosin Kingdom after Taksin was deposed in a coup d'état and executed."
 flavor_ayu.5.a: "It is the beginning of a new era!"
 flavor_ayu.5.b: "Let us focus on what we are instead of what we could be."

 flavor_ayu.6.desc: "We are a devout [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], and [target_ruler.GetName] wants to clearly set an example of this. To that effect, [target_ruler.GetSheHe] wants to sponsor the creation of a new temple in [target_location.GetName] to be used as the expression of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] authority. In there, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] is to perform ceremonies and thus cement [target_ruler.GetHerHis] connection to the faith."
 flavor_ayu.6.historical_info: "King Prasat Thong constructed in 1630 the first temple of his reign, the Wat Chaiwatthanaram, as a memorial of his mother. The temple's name means 'Temple of long reign and glorious era', was designed in Khmer style, and it was used to hold royal religious ceremonies and for the cremation of princes and princess. One hundred and twenty sitting Buddha statues, painted in black and gold, adorn the outside wall, while eight chedi-shaped chapels with Buddha statues in them surround the central platform. The exterior walls of these chapels are decorated by 12 reliefs depicting scenes from the life of Buddha and the inside ones are painted. The temple symbolizes the Buddhist world view, with the central tower representing the world axis and the four smaller towers around it representing the four continents in the four directions."

 flavor_ayu.7.title: "Furthering Horizons"
 flavor_ayu.7.desc: "In recent years, the world seems to have become bigger, as traders from far-away lands are steadily more common amongst our midst. We cannot deny the benefits that we can get from such trades, both in terms of products and technology, but many at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] fear the influence these foreigners can have on [target_ruler.GetName] if [target_ruler.GetSheHe] is to lend [target_ruler.GetHerHis] ears. We could establish some regulations to limit their trade, but that would undoubtedly antagonize them, while allowing them to roam freely may open ourselves to potential problems from within."
 flavor_ayu.7.a: "Increase trade regulations."
 flavor_ayu.7.b: "Allow trade to flow freely."

 flavor_ayu.8.title: "The Buddha's Footprint"
 flavor_ayu.8.desc: "A puddle of water resembling a large footprint has been found by a hunter in [target_location.GetName] and there are already voices claiming it to be a footprint of the Buddha. It is well known that during his lifetime, the Buddha left his footprints in all lands where his teachings would be acknowledged. As such, it is to nobody's surprise that we may have one of such footprints in our territory. Many in [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip] and all over our country are already asking [target_ruler.GetName] to properly house and worship the footprint."
 flavor_ayu.8.historical_info: "In 1624, a hunter found a depression in a stone in Saraburi, and it was believed to be the footprint of the Buddha. King Songtham of Ayutthaya then ordered the construction of a temple to protect it and worship, known as Wat Phra Phutthabat."
 flavor_ayu.8.a: "It is certainly a holy mark."
 flavor_ayu.8.b: "It is just a natural phenomena."

 flavor_ayu.9.title: "[target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_ayu.9.desc: "A most curious foreigner has appeared in our land. [target_character.GetName] has sailed all over the world, as [target_character.GetHerHis] mastery of languages and practical skills clearly show. [target_character.GetSheHe|U] has grabbed the attention of [target_ruler.GetName], as [target_character.GetSheHe] would be a very useful addition to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle], especially with [target_character.GetHerHis] skills in accounting. However, the inclusion of a foreigner into a prominent position at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] is sure to ruffle some feathers among the most established individuals in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], who would certainly not see with favorable eyes having their positions replaced."
 flavor_ayu.9.historical_info: "The Greek adventurer and merchant Constantine Phaulkon came to Siam in 1675 after having worked for England's East India Company. In England is where his original Greek name 'Gerakis' was translated into 'Falcon', which was later changed to 'Phaulkon' as a re-Helenization. He worked at the court of King Narai as a translator as he was fluent in Thai, English, French, Portuguese, and Malay. He became a counselor of the king not long after, rising to become highly influential at the Siamese court.\n\nMany members of the royal court envied the favor the king gave him, which spelled the end for both. Pra Phetracha, the foster brother of Narai, staged a coup d'état on the basis of some rumors about Phaulkon wanting to become ruler by using Phra Pui, the heir to the throne, as a puppet. That coup was the 1688 Siamese revolution, where Phaulkon and the royal heir were executed, while King Narai died several days later, leaving Phetracha to proclaim himself the new King of Siam."
 flavor_ayu.9.a: "This [target_character.GetWomanMan] is vital to our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]!"
 flavor_ayu.9.b: "A foreigner will always be a foreigner."

 flavor_ayu.1000.title: "The Issue of [target_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 flavor_ayu.1000.desc: "In recent years, the once mighty [target_country.GetLongName] has become no more than a subject under the authority of [target_origin_country.GetName]. Seizing an opportunity to gain more control over [target_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip], [target_ruler.GetName] has come up with the proposal of appointing [target_ruler.GetHerHis] own [target_origin_country.GetGovernment.GetHeirTitle] as the [target_country.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] of [target_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip]. This would certainly contribute to further integrate the [target_country.GetFlavorRank] into [target_origin_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip] in the future, being surely in the benefit of both."
 flavor_ayu.1000.historical_info: "King Borommatrailokkanat, also known as Trailok, was appointed in 1438 King of Sukhothai by his father, king Borommarachathirat II of Ayutthaya, when king Maha Thammaracha IV of Sukhothai died. At that point, he was only 7 years old, and when he was 15 he was sent by his father to the capital of Sukhothai to rule those territories in the king's name. When king Borommarachathirat II died, the prince was crowned King Borommatrailokkanat of Ayutthaya, thus cementing a union between both kingdoms."

They are sure to benefit from [target_heir.GetName]'s rulership as much as we are to gain from having them more closely tied to our administration."
 flavor_ayu.1002.desc_heir_refused: "The fools of [target_country.GetName] have refused to be led by [target_heir.GetName], and thus they have given away any chance they had to be as blessed in their governance as we are.

 flavor_ayu.1003.desc: "Ever since we became to rule also in the [target_country.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip], both our countries have been closing ties together. Many around [target_ruler.GetName] suggest formalizing this by completely integrating [target_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip] into the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName], thus merging both into a unified [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. The issue remains though, which should be the main title around which we should coalesce."
