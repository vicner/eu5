 flavor_tur.1.historical_info: "With the rise of the Safavid dynasty in Iran, the Ottomans gained a formidable foe. Just like the Roman empires before them, the Ottomans were drawn into prolonged and destructive wars with Iran. This time, the conflicts were not only over the beleaguered lands of the Middle East - there was an element of religious struggle too, since the Safavid had embraced Shia islam, while the Ottomans saw themselves as the inheritors of the Sunni caliphate."

 flavor_tur.3.historical_info: "The Treaty of Zuhab, also knowns as the Treaty of Qasr-e Shirin, was signed between the Ottoman Empire and Persia in 1639, and established borders that have changed little to this day. Hostilities between the two great empires decreased remarkably following the treaty as their relations steadily improved, but the border disputes did not disappear entirely, and in 1722, war broke out again. However, the treaty was dusted off and renewed in 1747."

 flavor_tur.5.desc: "The provincial governors, Beys, are powerful men, usually ambitious, and not always loyal. Despite this, their title is one of ancient pedigree among the Turks, and they have long been our best option for governing the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. A group of them, supported by many among the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')], are now demanding even greater local autonomy, saying that it will help them react quicker to any thorny local conflict that might arise."
 flavor_tur.5.historical_info: "Bey is a Turkic title for #italic chieftain#!, and also often used as a honorific for men with connections to ruling dynasties or governments. The title was used throughout Ottoman times, often to refer to provincial governors, along with the title Beylerbey, for the viceroys of the very largest provinces in the empire. In the 17th century, as the Ottoman government grew more bureaucratic and less focused on the personal authority of the sultan, these provincial governors gained even greater power."

Though it will surely infuriate the powerful merchant republics, whose traders have long enjoyed certain privileges in [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('constantinople')], it could benefit our economy in the long run."
 flavor_tur.6.historical_info: "Prior to his conquest of Constantinople Mehmed II signed several generous agreements with the mercantile empires of Venice and Genoa to ensure their neutrality, but when the great city had fallen he was not late in breaking the western merchants' strangle-hold on the Black Sea trade. Mehmed was a mercantilist who strived to maintain state control over the merchants, and for a time it proved an effective policy - the Ottoman economy thrived."

 flavor_tur.7.desc: "After the recent war, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] has begun to ponder further military reform. To keep developing the effectiveness of our martial hierarchy and our recruitment methods, we should further concentrate the military around elite slave-soldiers and specialized levies drawn from the lower classes, and try to break our reliance on the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] and their forces once and for all." 
 flavor_tur.7.historical_info: "The reigns of Mehmed I and Murad II saw the Ottoman Empire reunified after the crushing defeat it had suffered at the hands of Timur. This period saw the #italic devşirme#! system of slave soldiers, the sultan's personal army, truly gain prominence, and after the fall of Constantinople, the old Turkish warrior nobility was finally broken, many of their leaders exiled or executed. The military now rested firmly in the hands of the state."

 flavor_tur.8.desc: "In order to train administrators and generals for our growing realm, we could institute a school run by the inner circle of the court, to keep the students close to the ruler. This would not only allow us a great deal of insight, but would also bind the students to us, ensuring the continued importance of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetDynasty.GetName] dynasty in all matters of state.\n\nYet we shouldn't only allow nobles to enroll - but any youth gifted enough, no matter his background."
 flavor_tur.8.historical_info: "Mehmed II established a school in the courtyard of the newly constructed Topkapi Palace. Students were chosen from among the most promising Devşirme recruits (conscripted Christian youths), and were trained in the Islamic faith, the sciences, and the military arts, as well as many languages. The staffing of government posts with Devşirme recruits trained in the palace school and loyal to the sultan formed the backbone of the Ottoman system of patrimonial rule throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries."
 flavor_tur.8.a: "This is the future!"
 flavor_tur.8.b: "We should rather focus on expanding the Timar system."

 flavor_tur.9.title: "Rerouting Revenue"
 flavor_tur.9.desc: "To finance an expansion of the Timariot system, clever advisors have suggested that we could reroute some revenue from the Waqf, the mosque-based foundations that support charity towards the wretched and forlorn. This would certainly strengthen our army even further, and reduce the power of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')], but might cause widespread discontent once the more pious segments of the people learn about it."
 flavor_tur.9.historical_info: "Mehmed II sought to expand his personal power within the Ottoman Empire at all costs. Near the end of his reign he attempted to reduce the power of the ulema by rerouting revenues from the #italic waqf#! foundations that supported them to the timar system instead, strengthening the Ottoman army.

The [GetCountry('VEN').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has now sent a very strongly worded request that we pay reparations for lost revenue."
 flavor_tur.10.historical_info: "Though both Venice and the Ottomans benefited from their mutual trade relations, territorial disputes in the Aegean, and pressure on Venice by other Christian nations, inevitably pushed them into armed conflict. The Second Venetian-Ottoman War broke out in 1499, with the brilliant admiral Kemal Reis leading the Ottoman to several victories. Venice eventually sought aid from Hungary and the Papal States, and an armistice was agreed upon in which Venice had to cede the important Greek fortresses of Modon and Coron to the Turks."

If we ever aspire to be an empire, we must consider strengthening the bureaucracy and tying it closer to the palace and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetDynasty.GetName] dynasty, to curb the power of provincial elites once and for all. Traditionalists will loathe it though, since it'll be yet another step away from our roots on the steppes."
 flavor_tur.14.historical_info: "Süleyman I was probably the greatest of the Ottoman Sultans. Called Kanuni (Lawgiver), he was an unsurpassed administrator who realized that the power of the provincial Beys had to be curbed by a strong central government. Thus he struggled to promote a powerful royal bureaucracy which was not popular in all camps..."

 flavor_tur.15.desc: "If we are ever to be able to truly master the Eastern Mediterranean, we must invest even more into our naval strength. The old harbor of [GetCountry('GEN').GetName] in [ShowLocationName('constantinople')] would be the ideal site for a massive shipyard - but such an endeavor would not be cheap, of course." 
 flavor_tur.15.historical_info: "Shortly after the fall of Constantinople, Mehmet II established an imperial shipyard across the Golden Horn, probably at the site of the old Genoese shipyard Vetus Tersana. The shipyard was massively expanded during the reign of Selim I, an ascetic man with a sharp mind. By 1515, with over 160 docks constructed, it had truly surpassed the old Ottoman naval base at Gallipoli."

 flavor_tur.16.historical_info: "The Celali rebellions took place in Anatolia between 1519 and 1659. The uprisings were a symptom of the economic woes of many Ottoman subjects during this time, as state income from plunder had decreased and the trade routes had shifted away from the Middle East due to the discoveries made by the Europeans. Recognizing their grievances, the sultans sometimes acceded to some of the rebels' demands, and many rebel leaders were elevated to government positions. Weaker rebellions, such as the first one led by Celâl, were crushed by force."

This practice reflected the deep imprint of the Seljuk administrative system, where Persian bureaucrats and scribes had long played a crucial role in managing state affairs.

 flavor_tur.105.historical_info: "While the closure of the observatory in Constantinople in 1580 has sometimes been blamed on religious outrage among the public, it was rather a matter of politics. Taqī ad-Dīn had made enemies among many minor members of the bureaucracy and the 'Ulamā', who wanted to put him on trial for heresy. The observatory thus only survived for a few years, a great loss for the science of astronomy in the Muslim world."

 flavor_tur.107.historical_info: "Coffee drinking seems to have originated in Yemen in the 15th century, and by the end of the 16th, had spread throughout Ottoman lands. Coffee was shipped from the Yemeni port of Mokha to Cairo, where it was brought to every corner of the empire.

Merchants are complaining about outrageous price differences in our internal markets, where a wide variety of local currencies are in use. Soldiers are upset about not receiving their payment in time. But if we were prepared to debase our Akçe silver coins, it might be possible to alleviate these woes by unifying the economy of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], and increase the value of gold coins, which the state treasury still has in reserve."
 flavor_tur.108.historical_info: "Its not entirely clear why, in 1585, the Ottomans chose to debase the Akçe. It might have been necessary due to the cost of long wars with Persia, or because of an influx of silver from the New World. Local economies in the empire were very disjointed from each other, and the debasement may have been an attempt to unify them and strengthen the value of gold coins in relation to silver, for the state treasury's benefit. In the end these efforts had mixed results, and the currency remained unstable for several decades."

This would ensure that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetDynasty.GetName] dynasty never has a shortage of heirs." 
 flavor_tur.109.historical_info: "Ottoman fratricide fell out of favor in the late 16th century, after the gruesome murders during the enthronements of Murad III and Mehmed III, in which dozens of infants and young boys were slain. Male relatives of the sultan would instead be kept under various degree of house arrest in the harem, and kept passive by luxury and concubines. This ensured the vitality of the dynasty and the stability of the realm, but weakened the personal power of the ruler, since he became more easily replaced."

 flavor_tur.110.historical_info: "The capitulations, #italic Ahidnâme#! in Turkish, were charters that the Ottoman Empire signed with other nations, typically granting traders from those nations rights such as exemption from local taxation and prosecution while in Ottoman lands. Early recipients of capitulations were Venice and Genoa, but perhaps the most significant was the capitulation granted to France in 1535, which laid the foundations for the Franco-Ottoman alliance in years to come."

It features two clownish characters known as Karagöz and Havicat, whose antics draws huge crowds in tea houses and noble homes alike. Some members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] claim that the plays, which often feature crude and subversive themes, are an affront to [ShowReligionGroupName('muslim')], but to ban them would greatly enrage many urban dwellers."
 flavor_tur.111.historical_info: "The origins of the Karagöz shadow play tradition are uncertain. Some think it arrived with traders from Java, where shadow plays had been performed since the Middle Ages. By the 16th century, these often satirical and irreverent plays were performed in every city of the Ottoman Empire. $common_string_shaikh_al_islam$ Ebüssuûd Efendi issued a famous ruling that the plays were indeed permissible by Islamic law. In later centuries however, they would come to be repressed by the rulers due to their political content."

The land grants we give out to these cavalrymen have become more and more subdivided and poor, and our musket-armed enemies ensure that cavalry is not as dominant on the battlefield as in days of old. If we do not hand out any more Timar lands, we could, as their holders age and die, turn them into tax farms for the direct benefit of the state. The army could also be modernized, more focused on infantry soldiers armed with gunpowder weapons."
 flavor_tur.112.historical_info: "The Timar system of land grants to Sipâhi cavalrymen became unsustainable over time. As the great Ottoman conquests became a thing of the past, there was no longer enough land to hand out. Other factions in the army, especially the Janissaries, also demanded grants. Realizing that a reform was long overdue, the Ottomans abolished the system and came to rely more heavily on recruitment of Sekban soldiers from the peasantry."

These books are often written as if they were to be presented to [target_ruler.GetName], purporting to advise [target_ruler.GetHimHerFormal] in matters such as piety, morality, or political skill. But the authors have also begun to imply that our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] is deeply beset by problems, in a wretched state that only providence could alleviate. Are we still to allow these works to flourish?"
 flavor_tur.113.historical_info: "The Nasîhatnâme genre had many similarities to the Mirrors of Princes literature in Europe, but came to be characterized by an increasing sense of despondency, highlighting various perceived ailments of the Ottoman state. They looked back to a supposed golden age during the reign of Selim I. Later historians' somewhat mistaken notion that the 17th century was a period of decline for the Ottoman Empire was probably influenced by the Nasîhatnâme literature."

They demand decisions more favorable to [favored_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip], and that we sign a capitulation with that country."
 flavor_tur.116.historical_info: "At the Ottoman court, being enslaved was not a barrier to attaining positions of great influence. Eunuchs and concubines would not forget about the countries of their origin, and would sometimes create factions to push for political decisions that would benefit their homeland.

 flavor_tur.117.historical_info: "During the 16th century, the Ottoman Empire gradually transformed into a bureaucratic empire where the sultans wielded much less absolute power than they had done in the past.

 flavor_tur.126.historical_info: "The Ottomans struggled to maintain as many skilled sailors as their naval adversaries, especially Venice, who could draw manpower from her large merchant marine. This became very apparent in the 1656 Ottoman defeat at the Battle of the Dardanelles.

Yet among the elites of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')], many would rather see these subversive demagogues meet a swift end."
 flavor_tur.127.historical_info: "The radical conservative Kadızadeli movement were not dissimilar to the Wahhabis who arose a few centuries later, raging against supposed #italic innovations#! within the faith, and quickly became adversaries of the Sufi orders. Their ideology gained traction during the reigns of Murad IV and Mehmed IV, when they preached even in the Hagia Sophia.

The early 17th century also saw a large influx of scholars from Kurdistan and Iran, who argued for a revival of the rational sciences of the past.

A village or district will be auctioned to the highest bidder, who will then hold the right to tax it for life. This would improve our old system, [grand_vizier.GetSheHe] claims, by making a tax farmer more invested in the long-term welfare of his lands, and less prone to bleeding them dry before his tenure ends. It would also save us the bureaucratic hassle of administering all those one-year contracts that were the norm in ages past — but on the other hand, those were rather profitable."
 flavor_tur.132.historical_info: "The Malikâne system was introduced in 1695 by the ill-fated grand vizier Elmas Mehmed Pasha. He seems to have had good intentions, wanting to improve long-term economic gains, but partially failed. The system met fierce obstruction from the old generation of tax farm holders, and state oversight into the new type of life-time grants was lacking. Despite the reform, the state soon faced military losses and struggled to pay its soldiers. Elmas was killed by his own men in 1697, and in 1703, unpaid janissaries overthrew Mustafa II."

 flavor_tur.133.historical_info: "In the 17th century, opportunities for Ottoman scholars diminished. There was an abundance of madrasas in Constantinople, and thus no lack of access to education, but years of economic woes had caused salaries to decline, and with them, the general passion for abstract science.

When the Knights of Malta attacked ships carrying important pilgrims, and later unloaded some of their captives as slaves on Crete, this provided the Ottomans a perfect pretext for war with Venice.

The sultan agreed to dismiss some of the people from the list, but once the rebels got their hands on them, they were hanged.

 flavor_tur.147.historical_info: "Until the late 17th century, the only public libraries in the Ottoman Empire were minor facilities attached to mosques and charities. Though there were many archives, they were not widely accessible, and enormous literary treasures lay forgotten in storerooms like the Cairo Geniza. The Köprülü library, built in Constantinople in 1678, was the first public library in the Middle East, and afterwards, the Tulip Period ushered in a building boom of freestanding libraries with a book depot and a reading room, to various degrees inspired by European classical architecture."

Kösem was very politically savvy, but her alliance with the janissaries compelled her enemies to encourage Turhan's ambitions, and the younger woman began to plot against Kösem with the aid of Süleyman Ağa, the Chief Black Eunuch.

In 1654, a rebellion broke out in Habesh, Ottoman Eritrea, and the governor in Cairo was asked to mobilize troops.

Revolutionary nationalist sentiments grew strong among the Greeks during the 18th century, spurred on by the influences of enlightenment ideas as well as conscious subversive efforts from the Ottoman's European rivals.

Their unpredictable floods force many farmers to depend on income from other sources than agriculture, often bartering with the nomad groups of the deserts and grasslands.
