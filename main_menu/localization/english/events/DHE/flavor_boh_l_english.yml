Due to tensions between those faithful to Catholicism and Hussites during the reign of King Ladislaus, he gathered an army and marched to the capital and afterwards defeated all nobility still loyal to the Pope. In 1451, he was granted the administration of Bohemia by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederik III, and subsequently in 1458 he was elected by the estates of Bohemia, even by those still loyal to the Pope. His reign was marked by policies of peace and cooperation, but the Catholic opposition organized a rebellion with the help of King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, who invaded Bohemia to restore it to Catholicism."

The cathedral's design drew inspiration from Romanesque architecture in the Holy Roman Empire, particularly from the Hildesheim abbey church and the Speyer Cathedral. The Gothic version of the cathedral started to be constructed in 1344, when Prague became an archbishopric, but the Hussite wars in the 14th century caused construction to stop.
