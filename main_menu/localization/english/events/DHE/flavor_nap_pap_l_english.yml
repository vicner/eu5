 flavor_nap_pap.1.desc: "An excellent lecturer, [lorenzo_valla_scope.GetName], has recently met [country_ruler.GetName], sparking the interest of the sovereign in [lorenzo_valla_scope.GetHerHis] skills as a polemicist and philosopher. It seems the two got on together well, as [country_ruler.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] afterward proposed the funding of a school for the writer and enlisting [lorenzo_valla_scope.GetHerHis] skills in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle].\n\nMoreover, it would seem that [lorenzo_valla_scope.GetNameWithNoTooltip] has doubts regarding the ancient #italic Donation of Constantine#! and [lorenzo_valla_scope.GetSheHe] believes that [lorenzo_valla_scope.GetSheHe] can prove the work is a forgery. If [lorenzo_valla_scope.GetSheHe] is right, that would cause ripples in the [ShowReligionAdjective('catholic')] world." 
 flavor_nap_pap.1.historical_info: "Lorenzo Valla was a 15th-century Italian humanist, who made many contributions to the Italian Renaissance, mostly at the service of King Alfonso V of Aragon in Naples, after he conquered it. Valla is best remembered for his criticism of the #italic Donation of Constantine#!, a document upon which the Papal authority over the Catholic world was based, exposing it as a forgery, and humiliating the Papacy. Therefore, he is considered a founding father of textual criticism and Philology as an academic discipline."

 flavor_nap_pap.2.desc: "[lorenzo_valla_scope.GetName] did not lie when [lorenzo_valla_scope.GetSheHe] muttered [lorenzo_valla_scope.GetHerHis] doubts about the #italic Donation of Constantine#!. Having delved deeper into it, [lorenzo_valla_scope.GetSheHe] managed to find all sorts of inconsistencies in the work, proving that the #italic Donation#! is nothing more than a sham. What is done is done, and [lorenzo_valla_scope.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] has already been rewarded for his work. It now rests on us to decide whether to release the exposé or not."
 flavor_nap_pap.2.historical_info: "The #italic Donation of Constantine#!, allegedly granted to Pope Sylvester in the fourth century, is a forged Roman decree that bestowed the Papacy with seniority over the four other patriarchal sees and rights to the western portion of the Empire. This document was widely used by the Papacy since the 11th century as justification to protect various Papal interests."

 flavor_nap_pap.3.desc: "[lorenzo_valla_scope.GetName] of [nap_from.GetName] has produced a study on the origin of the #italic Donation of Constantine#!, deeming it a forgery. Despite our best efforts to find faults in the work, we could find few reasons to reasonably dispute anything within. Though the news has not reached every corner of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] world, it is bound to in due time.

This gives us the best chance yet to strike at [the_papacy.GetName] and to try to decrease [the_papacy.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] influence.
