 flavor_glh.1.title: "Tatar Yoke"
 flavor_glh.1.desc: "Following the successful invasion of the Rus' lands, we subjugated those who willingly opened their gates to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. To maintain control over the [ShowCultureGroupName('russian_group')] principalities, we have set up a complex tributary system demanding an annual tribute in coin and fighting-able men, to prevent any resurgence and suppress future challenges to our authority.\n\nTo encourage infighting among the princes, we are granting the generous title of [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('tatar_yoke').GetLeaderTitle] to whomever we see fit, who in return will collect taxes on our behalf from the remaining tributaries."
 flavor_glh.1.a: "Whatever keeps them in line."
 flavor_glh.1.tt: "[target_root_country.GetName] may choose a new [ShowSpecialStatusName('tatar_tax_collector')] for the [tatar_yoke.GetName] upon request"
 flavor_glh.1.historical_info: "The Tatar Yoke refers to the dominance and rule over Eastern Europe by the Golden Horde, who invaded the region in the thirteenth century and imposed a form of tributary system on the east Slavic duchies and principalities. The term 'yoke' refers to the tribute owed to the Mongols and Tatars, but also came to include the forced military service that was obligated to the Slavic subjects. The Tatar Yoke persevered until the Golden Horde started to decline in the fifteenth century."

It has, however, been suggested that the tributaries are able to provide additional coins to our coffers, which the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('tatar_yoke').GetLeaderTitle] has offered to collect on our behalf.
