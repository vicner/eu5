 flavor_mam.68.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] is far from the only owner of $mamluk$ in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. The households of influential manumitted $mamluk$ often contain as many, if not more of newly imported slaves from their home regions. These influential governors are often those with the greatest influence during a succession but even when the throne is occupied the influence of the $mamluk$ households is considerable in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] politics.

Bringing order to this maze of buildings, from the tombs of the [target_location.GetRank.GetName] of the dead and the slums of Fustat, to the bustling markets of Khan el-Khalili, or the great Citadel of [target_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip] itself, has long been a monumental task for many of our predecessors.

As the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], the responsibility lies with [target_character.GetName] to ensure safe passage. This is a position that in many ways requires both cunning and martial ability, as the way to proceed can range from defeating raiders to negotiating passage from local rulers, to outright threats or bribery.

Their sons however, the Awlād al-Nās, having grown up under far more convenient and forgiving circumstances, are generally considered far less able and loyal.

With codified rules, manuals, and popular competitions, the Furūsiyya has in many ways been perfected by Mamluk warrior aristocracy. While some chroniclers would claim that the champions of today could never compete with the warriors of the past, it is still both customary, and very popular, for any [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] to arrange big public Furūsiyya competitions, and the champions remain the heroes of many popular tales. All of this has inspired [target_character.GetName], an expert when it comes to warfare, and now wishes to organize even more tournaments among [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] warriors."

 flavor_mam.77.b: "The current production is sufficient."
 flavor_mam.77.historical_info: "Under the Mamluks, Egypt was renowned for its agricultural wealth and grain exports.
