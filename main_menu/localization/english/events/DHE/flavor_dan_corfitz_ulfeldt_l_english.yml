 flavor_dan_corfitz_ulfeldt.2.desc: "[target_character.GetName] has been continuously extending [target_character.GetHerHis] tendrils around all aspects of politics and affairs at court. [target_character.GetHerHis|U] influence and contacts with powerful members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] have started to become not just a nuisance but a threat to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] authority itself. If we do not curb [target_character.GetHerHis] ambition, [target_character.GetSheHe] is sure to eventually wrestle control of the whole [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] for [target_character.GetHerselfHimself]. There have also started to be allegations even of [target_character.GetHerHis] plans to assassinate members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] family."

If left to [target_character.GetHerHis] own devices, [target_character.GetSheHe] is sure to attempt to take the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] for [target_character.GetHerselfHimself]."
