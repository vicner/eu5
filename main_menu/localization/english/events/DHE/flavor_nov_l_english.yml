 flavor_nov.104.desc: "Though the Ushkuyniks have largely been active for centuries throughout [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], they have largely remained a brigand group that has received the patronage of various [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] families to target trade rivals. However, in recent times, members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] have taken to financing these pirates as well. With the rise of various principalities, many have urged the Veche and [our_ruler.GetName] to officially allow the sanctioning of the usage of the Ushkuyniks so that any mercantile threat to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] can be subjected to their piracy."

Repeated aggression by the Ushkuyniks has grown to be problematic, with many of the pirates taking action well beyond their intended goals, and causing more devastation than influence. With the Ushkuyniks having now grown to be seen as a pariah organization, some within the Veche have requested [our_ruler.GetName] decree their dissolution in order to help [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] recover its image."

Seeking to expand the office threefold, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] have requested that an additional position, the #italic Stepenny Posadnik#! be established as well, allowing for another elected position within the Veche. Some within the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] fear however this will just result in further power being consolidated to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] families of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

Though an elected position, these offices for quite some time now have been subsequently held by members of the same [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] family.\n\nSeeing the Posadnik as a position that has become encroached, many within the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] have called for the repealing of past reforms in hopes of curtailing [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] power.
