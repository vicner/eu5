flavor_byz.1503.historical_info: "Throughout the 14th century, the Aydinids, a Turkish Beylik based in western Anatolia, maintained a cordial yet complex relationship with the Byzantine Empire. Initially, they were involved in a series of alliances and confrontations with the Byzantines as they expanded their territory. At times, the Aydinid rulers cooperated with the Byzantines, serving as mercenaries or even allies against other Turkish Beyliks and the growing Ottoman Empire. However, this cooperation was often opportunistic and pragmatic, with both sides seeking to leverage the other's military strength for mutual benefit, such as crushing a neighboring foe."
