 flavor_ira.1202.desc: "It has now been centuries since there was a strong [ShowReligionAdjective('shia')] state either in [ShowRegionName('persia_region')] or elsewhere. With the birth of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] and our adherence to [ShowReligionNameWithNoTooltip('shia')], an increasing number of [ShowReligionAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('shia')] theologians, clerics, and all kinds of educated people have come flocking to our borders from all over the [ShowReligionGroupName('muslim')] world.\n\nThis is quite fortunate, as there is a shortage of [ShowReligionAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('shia')] lawyers, clerics, and officials in our lands, but this turn of events has made many [ShowReligionGroupNameWithNoTooltip('muslim')] rulers feel quite threatened by our state."

 flavor_ira.1301.desc: "The construction of the new [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] center at [target_location.GetName] is finally finished and before us now lie one of the greatest cities of the world.

In the process of completing the restructuring of the city, many new construction techniques have been born out of necessity and a generation of artisans and architects have developed their trades further than was previously thought possible."

 flavor_ira.1400.desc: "Our rivalry with [shared_rival.GetName] has proven to be more troublesome than anyone could have predicted. Being considered our equals, and not having a chance to top one another through war, it is suggested we find another way to bypass such costly conditions. Thankfully, many of our advisors have informed us of their ambitions set in [ShowContinentName('europe')], which has made them unpopular with the rulers there. The strongest of them being [target_country.GetName], who share the same hatred for these [shared_rival.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] conquerors. We should try to reach out to them and send them a delegate and a few gifts, and then we could properly create an alliance that would allow both of us to destroy this common rival."
 flavor_ira.1400.a: "Let us send them a diplomatic mission."
 flavor_ira.1400.b: "We will get rid of our enemies alone."
