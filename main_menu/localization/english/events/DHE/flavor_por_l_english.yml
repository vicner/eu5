 flavor_por.1.historical_info: "In 1492 Christopher Columbus undertook his famous journey for Castile and sailed west across the Atlantic in search of a western route to the Orient. Seven years earlier in 1485, Christopher Columbus had presented the same plan to the King of Portugal, John II, who after submitting the proposal to his experts had rejected it. Columbus had made yet another attempt to convince the King in 1488 but as the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias around this time had successfully rounded the Cape of Good Hope, an eastern sea route to Asia seemed more likely and the King once again rejected Columbus's proposal."

 flavor_por.2.historical_info: "The exploitation of land and resources in the New World colonies led to an extensive use of slave labor. As a large part of the indigenous population died from overwork and diseases spread from Europe, the labor shortage soon became problematic for the colonizers. Indentured servitude lessened this somewhat but failed to provide the workforce required. This was the start of the Atlantic slave trade, where slaves bought along the West African coast were transported to Brazil. Over 3 million African slaves were sent to Brazil, mainly to work on the vast sugar plantations."

After their expulsion from Ternate, the Portuguese established their new center of trade on the island of Ambon, which had been discovered by them in 1513. Though the Portuguese were regularly attacked by the native Muslims of the region, missionaries managed to convert a large number of them to Christianism. By the end of the 16th century, there were more than 50,000 Christians in the Moluccas, most of them living on Ambon."

The monastery would also become the burial place for Manuel I and future Portuguese Monarchs of the Houses of Aviz and Bragança. Work stopped in 1580 when Portugal, after the death of Sebastian I of Portugal and a succession crisis, entered into a union with Spain. When Portugal became independent again in 1640, the monastery saw further construction with the addition of a gold tiled ceiling in 1669 and large frescos completed at the end of the 18th century. In the 19th century, the remains of Vasco da Gama and Luís de Camões were transferred to the monastery as well."

 flavor_por.10.a: "Appoint de Sousa"
 flavor_por.10.historical_info: "Leading colonists were given strips of land that extended from the Brazilian coast reaching into the interior. The land owners, often captains, settled colonists in their respective Captaincies and were required to provide them with protection and justice. As these Captaincies were independent, they were unable to defend themselves from foreign pirates. Sent to Brazil by decree of King João III of Portugal, De Sousa was successful in combating piracy and intensifying colonization efforts into the interior of Brazil.

The treaty made in effect Portugal an economic and political satellite of England and was effectively in place until 1750, when King José I chose to ignore it, even while it was still formally in effect until 1836.

Until the 16th century, Madeira thrived as a major sugar market, witnessing the early application of slave labor in sugar production, later influencing larger overseas areas. However, competition from Brazilian and São Tomean plantations led to a decline in Madeiran sugar production, necessitating sugar imports from other Portuguese colonies.

Initially measured, Portuguese subjugation of the Saint Thomas Christians intensified after 1552, with strategic moves leading to the isolation of the community from its hierarchy by 1575.

 flavor_por.31.historical_info: "The expulsion of Muslims from Portugal, often overshadowed by the forced conversion of Jews, occurred in December 1496. Despite Portugal exhibiting higher tolerance for Muslim minorities than other European regions, Manuel I ordered their departure without clear provocation. Initially contemplating forced conversion or execution, the Portuguese government, fearing retaliation from North African Muslim kingdoms, opted for deportations. The motivations behind Manuel I's order remain unclear, with theories ranging from religious uniformity aspirations linked to the 'Catholic Monarchs' Isabella and Ferdinand to ambitions of conquering Morocco or influence from Dominican confessor Friar Jorge Vogado. The majority fled to North Africa."

 flavor_por.1000.historical_info: "The Portuguese carrack Santa Catarina was captured in February 1603 off the coast of Singapore by three ships of the Dutch East India Company (V.O.C.). The cargo, worth 2.2 million guilders, doubled the capital of the V.O.C., but the legality of keeping the prize was questionable under Dutch statute and led to protests from Portugal. The incident was a contributing reason for the Dutch-Portuguese War that lasted between 1602 and 1663."

She is said to be a lady-in-waiting to a bride to one of the important councillors of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. That alone is not much news of interest.

To have such a powerful dynasty from the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] estate dictate our future politics is humiliating and downright dangerous. It is believed that those relatives are trying to convince [target_character2.GetNameWithNoTooltip] to even claim the throne of our fellow neighbor, which could get dangerous."
