 flavor_wittelsbach_house_union.1.desc: "While the dynastic treaty signed in 1329 in [ShowLocationName('pavia')] did stabilize our dynastic relations, the position of [target_ruler.GetName] has improved since then and we could now try to increase our authority over [target_character.GetName] and [GetCountry('PAL').GetName]. This would brand us as an untrustworthy ally and a tyrannical leader of the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetName]. Honoring the treaty would preserve our diplomatic standing and reputation and enable us to unify the branches of the [target_ruler.GetDynasty.GetName] Dynasty peacefully in the future."
 flavor_wittelsbach_house_union.1.a: "Honor the Treaty!"
 flavor_wittelsbach_house_union.1.a.tt: "If either side of the treaty finds themselves in an interregnum, the other side will be able to inherit the land and the electoral status of the country."
 flavor_wittelsbach_house_union.1.b: "Enforce our superiority on [GetCountry('PAL').GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 flavor_wittelsbach_house_union.1.historical_info: "The Treaty of Pavia of 1329 was the foundation of the separation of the House of Wittelsbach into the Bavarian and Palatine lines, which ruled over the Wittelbacher territories respectively. In addition to the split between the two branches, the treaty also attempted to solve the question of the Electorship. While the initial rule was an alternation of the electorate between the Palatinate and the Duchy of Upper Bavaria the role of elector was later confirmed to stay with the Palatinate of the Rhine. The Treaty also included an agreement that either dynastic line would fall into the hands of other if the current ruler had no direct male heirs."

 flavor_wittelsbach_house_union.2.desc: "The Treaties of our dynasty signed in 1329 in [ShowLocationName('pavia')] have been once again confirmed by [GetCountry('UBV').GetName]. Honoring the treaty seems to be the most beneficial course of action for us, but we might be able to claim the lands held by our relatives in [GetCountry('UBV').GetNameWithNoTooltip]."

 flavor_wittelsbach_house_union.3.desc: "With the death of [target_character.GetName], the [target_character.GetDynasty.GetName] Dynasty of [GetCountry('PAL').GetName] has died out and the throne stays unoccupied. With the agreements made in the old Treaty of [ShowLocationName('pavia')], we have a strong claim to their lands and could press them to a unification of the ancient [target_ruler.GetDynasty.GetName] lands into a single country."
 flavor_wittelsbach_house_union.3.a: " The [target_ruler.GetDynasty.GetNameWithNoTooltip] lands must never be separate again."
 flavor_wittelsbach_house_union.3.historical_info: "In the year of 1777, the Bavarian Elector and Duke Maximillian III Joseph died without leaving a male heir to inherit his possessions. According to the Treaty of Pavia and several other dynastic treaties between Bavaria and the Palatinate, his titles did now fall into the hands of Karl IV Theodor of the Palatine branch of the House of Wittelsbach. Although this sparked the Bavarian Succession War, a new state composed of the two previous electorates was born. This merged re-unified electorate would eventually transition into the Kingdom of Bavaria."
