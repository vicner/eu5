 flavor_ori.1.title: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] and the cult of Jagannātha"
 flavor_ori.1.desc: "The ceremonies at the great temple in [GetLocationName('puri')] and the log in which Jagannātha manifests himself have at times been ridiculed and mocked by foreign rulers, but in [GetAreaName('orissa_area')] Jagannātha, the 'Lord of the Universe' is undisputedly the most popular deity.\n\nThe support of Jagannātha and his priests have also been unwavering for [target_character.GetName]. Now the time has come for the [target_character.GetDynasty.GetName] dynasty to repay this debt, we should patronize the temple at [GetLocationNameWithNoTooltip('puri')] and elevate the worship of Jagannātha as the primary cult in our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
 flavor_ori.1.a: "Praise Jagannātha!"
 flavor_ori.1.b: "Let us not put all of our eggs in one basket."

 flavor_ori.2.title: "The Price of War."
 flavor_ori.2.desc: "Recent wars have caused instability within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] have been turning against us slowly from our costly wars, and a number of bad harvest seasons have radicalized them further. After some surveys, we have found out their main complaint is our taxes on salt, a vital resource for much of the common folks. [target_character.GetName] and [target_character.GetHerHis] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] have suggested a decrease on those taxes in order to ease up the unrest."
 flavor_ori.2.historical_info: "When Kapilendra Deva overthrew the last of the Eastern Ganga Kings in 1434, Orissa was in a sad state. Muslim incursions from the north and west as well as rivalry with other neighbors to the south had reduced the kingdom greatly. Since then, Raja Kapilendra quickly turned all of that around. In consecutive wars with Bengal, the Reddys of Andhra, the Bahmani Sultans, and the Vijayanagar empire, Orissa grew in both size and strength under his leadership. This constant warfare had, however, taken its toll on the kingdom's population, and with a mix of bad harvest seasons led to popular unrest within the realm."
 flavor_ori.2.a: "We don not need the Salt tax."
 flavor_ori.2.b: "We cannot bow to public pressure."

 flavor_ori.3.title: "Birth of [ShowLanguageNameWithNoTooltip('oriya_language')] Literature"
 flavor_ori.3.desc: "Up until now, [ShowLanguageName('sanskrit_language')] has been the only language of literature in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], with the colloquial [ShowLanguageName('oriya_language')] language being reserved for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] and lower castes. [sarala_dasa.GetName], a retired soldier with little formal education has begun to change this, however, by translating the [ShowAdvanceName('mahabarata')] into [ShowLanguageNameWithNoTooltip('oriya_language')]. [sarala_dasa.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s original work is also exclusively in [ShowLanguageNameWithNoTooltip('oriya_language')] and other poets have now begun to take up this practice."

 flavor_ori.5.desc: "With the rule of [target_character2.GetName] still ongoing, a new figure has risen through the ranks in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. [target_character.GetHerHis|U] name is [target_character.GetName], an eager and shrewd strategist determined to protect [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] from external threats. However, murmurs within our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] suggest that [target_character.GetSheHe] may be scheming to claim the throne, aiming to usurp [target_character2.GetName] and eliminate the last remnants of the [target_character2.GetDynasty.GetName] dynasty from [ShowAreaName('orissa_area')]."

Rallying thousands of soldiers, it seems inevitable that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will face a civil war unless [target_character2.GetName] abdicates the throne to [target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."

Among them is the $kapilesvara_siva_temple$ that is scheduled to be built in [target_location.GetName], a site rumored to be the birthplace of [ShowGodName('shiva_god')]."

 flavor_ori.9.title: "Decline of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] Militarism"
 flavor_ori.9.desc: "Although we once marched forth and conquered, it is clear that those glories are now far behind us. Many citizens of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have forgotten the ways of the warrior, embracing a life of peace instead. While this may not bode well for the strength of our army, perhaps it is time for us to embrace a more peaceful approach to governance."
 flavor_ori.9.a: "[target_character.GetNameWithNoTooltip] shall become an administrator."

By ensuring that militarism permeates every aspect of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] society, a standing army will be established to secure the borders and potentially launch invasions against weaker neighbors."

 flavor_ori.11.title: "Decline of Maritime Trade"
 flavor_ori.11.desc: "As our connections with $china$ and [ShowSubContinentName('south_east_asia')] dwindle, so too does our trade with them. In the past, we relied heavily on exporting our rich cloth and salt production to these regions, but recent changes within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and among our trade partners have caused this decline. [target_character.GetName] seeks to counter this trend by introducing a more open trading system. However, this move risks undermining the influence of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] in other markets."

However, our current [ShowBuildingTypeName('elephant_hunting_grounds')] lack the resources needed to properly expand their hunting operations and supply adequate equipment. It may be time to provide them with the support they require. [target_character.GetName] and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle], in particular, are even willing to allocate some of their own funds to make this a reality."

 flavor_ori.15.desc: "Part of the ancient architecture of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], the Kalinga style of architecture distiguishes the temples dedicated to each major [ShowReligionName('hindu')] deity, ensuring that each of them have a distinct style.

Unfortunately, political conflicts and religious turmoil forced us to change our ways, instead steering our nation away from our original beliefs. Although [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] does not necessarily believe that [ShowGodName('vishnu_god')] is the supreme being of all deities, the masses think otherwise, reminding us that the cult of Jagannātha is indeed the only true words within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetName]. This pressure alone has made the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] reconsider their stance. Perhaps, they too will believe that [ShowGodNameWithNoTooltip('vishnu_god')] stands supreme and that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] needs to change its stance on what branch of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetNameWithNoTooltip] is right."
