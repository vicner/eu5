 flavor_nav.10.desc: "[target_character.GetName], the first and oldest daughter of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName], is waiting for the entourage that will accompany [target_character.GetHerHis] to [target_character.GetHerHis] new life in [ShowLocationName('paris')].\n\nWhen [target_character.GetSheHe] was born, the stars seemed to smile at [target_character.GetHerHis], being the heiress to all that [target_character.GetHerHis] parents owned, but no more. [target_character.GetHerHis|U] marriage with [GetCountry('ARA').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] was canceled and [target_character.GetSheHe] became an obstacle for [target_character.GetHerHis] younger sister [target_sister.GetShortName].\n\nNow [target_character.GetSheHe] will join the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] in [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('paris')] and serve our Lord and Saviour.\n\nHowever, some wonder if [target_character.GetSheHe] could not be still of use to the realm, and be a possible asset in other diplomatic negotiations."
 flavor_nav.10.a: "[target_character.GetSheHe|U] will become a nun."
 flavor_nav.10.b: "[target_character.GetSheHe|U] can still be of use."
 flavor_nav.10.historical_info: "Despite the fact that Jeanne was betrothed to Peter IV of Aragon, the marriage never happened. Historians argue that she might have had some kind of defect, or perhaps she was ill, that made her less appealing as a spouse to her future husband. In any case, Maria, her younger sister took her place and married Peter instead.\n\nSo that the marriage happened, Jeanne was forced to renounce her succession rights and entered the Franciscan Abbey of Longchamp, near Paris, as a Poor Clare."
 flavor_nav.20.title: "San Francisco de Olite"
 flavor_nav.20.desc: "As a devoted person, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] cannot accept the slow advancement of the works of the Convent of San Francisco in [ShowLocationName('olite')].\n\nThe convent was started more than a century ago and cannot be considered finished yet.\n\nDespite the impact that hurrying the works could do on our treasury, the place and our prestige could be greatly benefited."
 flavor_nav.20.a: "Praise God!"
 flavor_nav.20.b: "It has waited, it can still wait."
 flavor_nav.20.historical_info: "According to legend, Saint Francis of Assisi founded the Olite convent during his pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela (around 1213-1214).\n\nFounded by King Theobald II, later Navarrese monarchs, especially Jeanne II and Charles II, supported the order financially and spiritually, fostering its growth and devotion.\n\nOver time, the convent underwent changes, becoming an 'Apostolic College' for training and sending missionaries to Spain and America, or serving as a hospital during the Convention War in 1795."
 flavor_nav.30.title: "Irrigation Projects in Tudela"
 flavor_nav.30.desc: "Even when our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] spends a lot of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerHis] time in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerHis] possessions in [ShowRegionName('france_region')], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetSheHe] always has time to develop new projects in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName].\n\nThe southern parts of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], around [ShowLocationName('tudela')], are known for their fertility, but also their dryness, and digging some canals to improve the irrigation of the fields can make the crops grow stronger."
 flavor_nav.30.a: "The terrain will be far more productive."
 flavor_nav.30.b: "We cannot indulge ourselves with these expenses."
 flavor_nav.30.historical_info: "During their reign, both Jeanne II and Philippe III undertook several economic development projects across the Kingdom of Navarre, including the expansion of the irrigation systems around Tudela, the most important city in the south of the Kingdom."
 flavor_nav.40.title: "A Copy of the Fueros of Navarra"
 flavor_nav.40.desc: "As the involvement of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] with the daily duties of the realm becomes more common, a copy of the #italic Fueros of Navarre#! has been ordered for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerHis].\n\nThe proposed copy will be beautifully decorated, with a nice leather cover of the best quality and written by the most skillful copists in the realm. As it is traditional, the text will be written in [spanish_language.GetName], with its interesting [basque_language.GetName] terms here and there.\n\nUnfortunately, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] speaks in [french_language.GetName] and cannot speak the Navarrese Romance."
 flavor_nav.40.a: "A translation to [french_language.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will be added."
 flavor_nav.40.b: "Perhaps it is time our rulers learn the language of the land."
 flavor_nav.40.c: "Basque should be the official language if it is the most spoken."
 flavor_nav.40.historical_info: "While it is likely that most of the population in the Kingdom of Navarra had Basque (#italic Lingua Navarrorum#!) as their mother language, the official documentation of the realm was mostly written in Navarro-Aragonese (#italic Ydiomate Navarre Terrae#!, #italic Ydiomate Navarre#! or #italic Lengoage de Navarra#!) as Occitan fell in decay.\n\nAdditionally, French variants were also common since the first French dynasties entered the realm, starting with the House of Champagne in 1234."
 flavor_nav.50.title: "The Siege of Algeciras"
 flavor_nav.50.desc: "News of war in the [target_country.GetAdjective] border has reached the realm. [GetCountry('CAS').GetName] has resumed the Crusade against [target_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip] and [target_character.GetName] has quickly returned to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to take part in the fights.\n\nDespite the apparent lack of benefit for our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], we have always felt it was our duty to help our neighbors expel the [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('muslim')] from [ShowRegionName('iberia_region')]."
 flavor_nav.50.a: "[target_character.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] will command our fighters."
 flavor_nav.50.b: "We must send men to the Crusade, but we should not send [target_character.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]."

 flavor_nav.50.historical_info: "In 1343, King Philippe of Navarre prepared to join the crusade against Granada, emphasizing his duty as ruler of an Iberian kingdom. His presence at the siege of Algeciras, supported by provisions from the Bay of Biscay, was crucial despite a small military force. Unfortunately, Philippe fell ill, leading to his death in September 1343. His body was returned to Pamplona for burial, while his heart found its resting place in Paris. Jeanne, his widow, received condolences from Pope Clement VI. Algeciras eventually fell, and Jeanne continued to reign until she died in 1349, leaving the crown to their son, Charles II."
 flavor_nav.60.title: "The Will of a Queen"
 flavor_nav.60.desc: "The [target_character.GetName] is dead and [target_character.GetHerHis] will has been read. In it, [target_character.GetHeSheFormal] asks [target_character.GetHerHis] successor to add a chapel to the church of Santa Maria la Real in [ShowLocationName('olite')].\n\nAmong the courtesans, some proposals of devoting the chapel to the Conception of Holy Mary have been made. Our ruler, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName], is quite convinced of the idea as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetSheHe] knows how devoted [target_character.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] was."
 flavor_nav.60.a: "The will of a mother must be obeyed."
 flavor_nav.60.b: "We have better uses for that money in mind."

 flavor_nav.70.title: "The Cámara de Comptos"
 flavor_nav.70.desc: "Finances of a realm are a serious thing and our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] believes that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] will greatly benefit if we found a permanent institution to handle these issues.\n\nDrawing inspiration from similar institutions in the [GetCountry('FRA').GetLongName], we will make our nation more economically viable and capable of handling better the possible financial struggles that our delicate situation can make us face."
 flavor_nav.70.a: "A permanent court will be established."
 flavor_nav.70.historical_info: "The origin of the Cámara de Comptos can be found in the #italic oidores#! (from the verb #italic oir#!, 'to hear'), officers that administered and supervised the royal finances since at least 1258, when the first Book of Comptos can be dated. This institution, deeply influenced by similar French ones (as the #italic Chambre des Comptes#! of Paris), was made permanent by King Charles II and carried the duty of controlling the expenses of the realm and advice the rulers in financial matters.\n\nIt is considered the oldest Court of Auditors of Spain and it is still in use, serving the Parliament of the Chartered Community of Navarre."
