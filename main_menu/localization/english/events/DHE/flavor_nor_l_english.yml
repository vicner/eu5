 flavor_nor.5.desc: "Ever since the 13th century treaty of Perth, [GetCountry('SCO').GetName] has been obligated to pay a yearly sum to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] in exchange for control of the Hebrides. These payments are by now long overdue, however, and this has been the cause for tensions on and off. Regardless of our ancestral claims, however, our ability to project power in the [ShowAreaName('scottish_highlands')] is not what it was, and we have bigger issues closer to home to handle. It has been suggested that this conflict be settled once and for all. The Jarldom of [ShowLocationName('orkney')] will be pawned and then transferred to the Scots.\n\n[ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('orkney')] remains one of the highest ranked titles in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip] however, one that has at times been a stepping stone to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] throne. While they remain a weak factor, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] are very wary of this deal."

 flavor_nor.16.title: "Hollendertiden"
 flavor_nor.16.desc: "Timber has always been a major export of the Norwegian economy and trade ships from the Low Countries have become an increasingly common sight along the Norwegian coastline. Unlike the Hanseatic traders who have dominated our economy for centuries the Dutch are content to trade without meddling in local businesses or breaking the laws of the land.\nWith an ever growing demand from the Dutch shipbuilders the timber industry in Norway could well grow to be the biggest in Europe. As a seafaring and shipbuilding people we can undoubtedly learn a lot from the Dutch entrepreneurs by aligning with them against the Germans."

 flavor_nor.23.desc: "For three days fires have ravaged the timber city of Oslo and now all but a few buildings in our country's capital lie in ashes. While fire has haunted Oslo before the destruction we face now is so final that it has been suggested we should relocate the city entirely as we rebuild. Instead of building in timber and awaiting the next catastrophe it has been suggested that we rebuild closer to Akershus fortress, using sounder techniques of construction and city planning as befits a capital of our age.\nRebuilding closer to Akershus will also allow us to properly fortify the city, which can be of great benefit in these times. In practice previous rulers have found it hard to prevent the citizens of Oslo to rebuild in whichever materials and mode they wish however, so a proper renovation is likely to be very costly."

 flavor_nor.24.desc: "Over time the extensive integration of Norway into the economy of the rich cities in the Low Countries have led to a growing shipbuilding industry at home. Norwegian cities strongly tied to the timber trade are quickly growing bigger than ever before, with Norwegian, Dutch, Danish, Scottish, English and Swedish merchants blending together to create a cosmopolitan maritime environment.\nYoung Norwegian men have also begun to migrate in increasing numbers to the Low Countries. Some settle there while others continue onto the open seas. The growing number of Norwegian expatriates and those who eventually return to our lands are together immersing our country ever more deeply into the emerging global economy."
 flavor_nor.24.a: "The sea is our future and our past."
