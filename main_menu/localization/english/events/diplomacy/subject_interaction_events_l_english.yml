 subject_interaction_events.1.desc: "The former monarch of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] had [target_previous_ruler.GetHerHis] supporters, and many them believe they have a better claim to the throne of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] than [target_ruler.GetName].

 subject_interaction_events.5.a: "If we ever had doubts, they are long forgotten now."

 subject_interaction_events.7.title: "Military Support Misused"
 subject_interaction_events.7.desc: "The support we sent our subject state has been used in ways we could never have foreseen! The men have been forced to build roads and buildings, clean town squares from litter and garbage and not once have they seen battle. Though the roads are broader and better than before, the buildings sturdier and the town squares immaculate, surely this was not how these men were supposed to be used?"

 subject_interaction_events.9.title: "The Military Menace"
 subject_interaction_events.9.desc: "We have had no shortage of manpower since our overlord started subsidizing our army, but there's been much trouble among the soldiers since the new ones arrived. Their culture, language, traditions and sometimes even religion differ from our own soldiers, and this causes a lot of trouble for us. They are less disciplined, or just plain refuses to take orders from our own generals."
 subject_interaction_events.9.a: "Send them back to where they came from."
 opinion_purged_manpower: "Purged useful but badly disciplined soldiers"

 subject_interaction_events.10.desc: "There are always trouble when people from different cultures, with different languages, traditions and sometimes even religion come together and must work as an unit even when so many things differ from them.

 subject_interaction_events.14.title: "Embargoes and Smugglers"
 subject_interaction_events.14.desc: "Recent embargoes against our overlord's rivals might be the end of us, financially. Thankfully, there are esteemed individuals in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] who would graciously help us with our trading problem. Though it might be silly to call such a small operation 'smuggling', that is exactly what it is and as we might be breaking some of the embargoes our overlord demanded of us, they will probably not be happy with our misconduct."
 subject_interaction_events.14.a: "An opportunity like this seldom appears, we must accept!"
 subject_interaction_events.14.ct: "There's a slight chance our overlord might notice this"
 subject_interaction_events.14.b: "It is not worth risking our overlord's wrath for this."

 subject_interaction_events.15.title: "Our Vassal's Smugglers"
 subject_interaction_events.15.desc: "Our embargoes against our rivals are not working as well as we had hoped them to, and one reason might be that one of our vassals is still trading with them! They are smuggling goods back and forth and thus interfering with our goals and making us appear weak. The smuggling is very minor, but could become very damaging to us.\nOn the other hand powerful business interests would be willing to pay for ignoring the smuggling."

 subject_interaction_events.17.title: "War Never Changes"
 subject_interaction_events.17.desc: "In exchange for some peace and quiet, our vassals are obliged to pay more income to us, their overlord. They are not called into any of our wars, which we believe is a great trade-off - for some gold they are excluded from almost all wars. One of our vassals wonder if it weren't better if they were called into wars instead of paying these - in their meaning - 'ridiculous sums'."
 subject_interaction_events.17.a: "Ungrateful morons!"

 subject_interaction_events.18.title: "Benefits of Scutage"
 subject_interaction_events.18.desc: "As our war-ravaged land are slowly being rebuilt, we have noticed a look in our vassal's ambassador's eyes, a look of comprehension and fear mixed with some relief that the land they are looking at is not their own.

 subject_interaction_events.21.title: "The Loyalist Embarrassment"
 subject_interaction_events.21.desc: "Though we all appreciate the patriots, the loyalists, the ones who love their country and will protect it to all costs, when they manage to embarrass us in front of the whole court their lovability decreases fiercely. This is not what we pay for, that handsome sum that every month disappears into their greedy pockets! The relationship we try to protect is worth more than their lice-filled heads."

 subject_interaction_events.22.title: "Successful Loyalists"
 subject_interaction_events.22.desc: "The money sent to loyalists in one of the countries that is a subject to us with has been well spent, more than we could ever have imagined and anticipated. The Liberty Desire of their people has lowered well beyond what we thought possible."

 subject_interaction_events.24.title: "The Cruel Behavior of Uncouth Officers"
 subject_interaction_events.24.desc: "'Many small streams creates a large flood' - a proverb that unfortunately proved true in our protectorate. Small events, barely noticeable to us but great slights to those who witnessed or were exposed to them, together with older complains and bitter memories from when the country became our protectorate became the final straw.

 subject_interaction_events.25.title: "A Gentleman and an Officer"
 subject_interaction_events.25.desc: "The code of conduct we tried to imprint in every officers' mind before they left our country to work as army instructors in one of our protectorates might not have been time wasted.

 subject_interaction_events.30.title: "The Hole Called Bankruptcy"
 subject_interaction_events.30.desc: "A ruler keen of the very best the country can provide, a treasury governed by greedy and incompetent persons, investments that went wrong and too many loans... That is how you dig the hole called bankruptcy, and it might have been all those or just one that made one of our subjects stumble into the hole and fall all the way to the bottom. We can help them get partially out of that hole with a donation of money, or ignore it and make them help themselves."

 subject_interaction_events.36.desc: "It appears our country is getting rather empty and lacking in a very important resource: Cannon fodder. Fear not!

 subject_interaction_events.38.title: "An Extra Tax"
 subject_interaction_events.38.desc: "It would be an understatement to say our economy is performing 'poorly', in fact some would say this is a disaster. While we struggle to make ends meet our subjects, of all people, are doing more than well. Perhaps we are not taxing them enough."
