 unionevents.1.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetFullRulerName|U] seems to be favoring [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetCulture.GetName] nobles, instead of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCulture.GetName] nobles.

 unionevents.2.desc: "Our common ruler is very focused on [target_ruler.GetHerHis] own [union_target.GetFlavorRank], and does not seem to be devoting sufficient time to the affairs of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. It is clear that this is not something that our people appreciate."

 unionevents.3.title: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] neglected economically"
 unionevents.3.desc: "Although we are united in the person of our sovereign, our nation's merchants are still treated as foreigners. This is hurting our nation economically. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetFullRulerName|U] should spent more time in our country, and make it prosper!"

 unionevents.98.title.fallback: "The [GetInternationalOrganizationType('union').GetNameWithNoTooltip] and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]"
 unionevents.98.desc: "With the death of [root_character.GetName], the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] stands without any ruler. Usually, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetHeirSelection.GetName] would find us a new candidate to rule over the state swiftly. However, circumstances are different as we are part of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetDiplomacy.GetUnion.GetName], and as such the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] stands before a rather unique decision."
 unionevents.98.desc.union_has_leader: "$unionevents.98.desc$\n\n[target_character.GetName], current leader of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetDiplomacy.GetUnion.GetNameWithNoTooltip], demands the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] throne. If we want to stay and possibly overtake the [GetInternationalOrganizationType('union').GetName], electing [target_character.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] might be a valid choice, though in high contrast to the values of a [ShowGovernmentTypeName('republic')]."
 unionevents.98.desc.union_has_no_leader: "$unionevents.98.desc$\n\n[target_character.GetName] might be now in charge of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetDiplomacy.GetUnion.GetNameWithNoTooltip], but is in way a valid candidate for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] government. In order to maintain our position in the [GetInternationalOrganizationType('union').GetName], it would be possible to make an exception for [target_character.GetHerHim], though many of our people will lose faith in the [ShowGovernmentTypeName('republic')] as a result of this."
 unionevents.98.fallback: "Where once was a [GetInternationalOrganizationType('union').GetName] is now only a diplomatic and administrative mess within the offices of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName]. The [ShowGovernmentTypeName('monarchy')] might come and go, but the [ShowGovernmentTypeName('republic')] persists."
 unionevents.98.a: "Elect [target_character.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]!"
