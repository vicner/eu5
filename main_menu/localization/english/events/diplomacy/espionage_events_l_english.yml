 espionage_events.1.title: "Half the Loyalty, Double the Agent"
 espionage_events.1.desc: "Espionage may be the hardest test there is for loyalty to one's country. Both fear and temptations surround spies constantly, and the better they are at what they do, the more certain they are to face them. These temptations, of course, are something we are more than willing to provide foreign agents.\n\nAn agent from [espionage_event_country.GetName], a country where corruption is rampant, has recently decided to give in to one of these temptations. Eager to make a bigger profit than most can hope to earn through bribes, he has offered to act as a double agent for us. However, the 'anonymous' method of contact he chose has turned out to be less anonymous than expected, so we now know his name. How shall we proceed?"
 espionage_events.1.a: "Accept the offer for a lesser sum and spare his life."
 espionage_events.1.b: "Shadow him for a few days before he has an accident."
 espionage_events.2.title: "Second Chance for a Traitor"
 espionage_events.2.desc: "We are more than aware of the corruption plaguing [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] society, but we had at least hoped that it did not go beyond money changing hands between our own citizens. We were wrong. Associates of an agent maintaining our spy network in [origin_country.GetName] have proven recently that he has accepted a sum of money that could only have come from the [origin_country.GetAdjective] government. We have to accept that one of our best was not as loyal as we hoped.\n\nSome say that this operation may be salvaged yet. If confronted with evidence of his betrayal, he might be ready to switch back to his original allegiance - with the added benefit of having the trust of the [origin_country.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip]. Is it worth the risk?"
 espionage_events.2.a: "He'll be even more valuable to us now."
 espionage_events.2.b: "He has done enough damage already. Invite him home for the last time."
 espionage_events.3.title: "Twice the Traitor?"
 espionage_events.3.desc: "The difficult thing about relying on people of low character is that they have rarely been swayed for the last time. The [espionage_event_country.GetAdjective] spy we offered a large sum of money and our mercy for turning double agent against his country seems to have been discovered by those he betrayed. Our other spies report that he was offered to continue working for both nations, but with his true allegiance shifted back to his home country.\n\nThat the offer has been made, there can be no doubt about. His coming out of it alive means he must have, at the very least, pretended to accept. Despite this, he may still be working for us and could only be handing token information to the enemy. Can we afford to take our chances?"
 espionage_events.3.a: "This is getting ridiculous, and so is the notion of trusting him."
 espionage_events.3.tt_1: "If the agent is now loyal to them:"
 espionage_events.3.b: "He fooled them again? He's pretty good."
 espionage_events.3.tt_2: "If the agent is still loyal to us:"
 espionage_events.4.title: "Seal of Confession"
 espionage_events.4.desc: "Religious institutions are considered sacrosanct and above the petty plots and schemes of countries and spies. This is why it's crucial to infiltrate them. Many secrets that would never be spoken aloud are told in confidence to religious authorities, which the practice of confession has even turned into an institution.\n\nA church in [victim_country.GetName], a country on which we have focused our espionage efforts, has presented an unprecedented opportunity to exploit this. One of our loyal agents, posing as a nun in a local convent, has found that she can overhear the conversations from confessionals while doing chores in the church. While she is likely to escape detection, the plan would outrage religious authorities if discovered. Is it worth taking our chances?"
 espionage_events.4.a: "Their sins may be of interest, even if we cannot absolve them..."
 espionage_events.4.b: "Unthinkable! She should inform the priests that they can be heard."
 espionage_events.5.title: "Pope Discovers Plot"
 espionage_events.5.desc: "Our plan to use information from confessionals to improve our intelligence gathering in [victim_country.GetName] has resulted in a diplomatic disaster with the Papacy, as our agent was discovered a few months into the operation. Facing the wrath of the Church, she has since disappeared from the convent along with her belongings; whether this is her own doing or the actions of the enemy, we may never know.\n\nWe can be certain, however, that the Church found out enough to realize we were behind what happened. The Pope is shocked that we would exploit the Church and its practices in this way. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] enjoys some plausible deniability, but the country's standing is still irreversibly harmed."
 espionage_events.5.a: "Is it too late to ask for forgiveness?"
 espionage_events.8.title: "Spymaster Suspects Neighbors"
 espionage_events.8.desc: "Having a spymaster in our employ has mainly contributed to our intelligence gathering abroad, but our Spymaster sometimes coordinates counterespionage as well. Recently, investigations have uncovered a conspiracy that could only be the work of one of our neighboring countries. Which neighbor is behind it remains unclear, but the constant exchanges of information would require those behind it to be close by.\n\nOur spymaster has prepared to round up and harshly question a number of foreign officials who might be involved, but conflicting theories about the culprits leaves it up to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] to decide who to target. Our neighbors will probably not appreciate the accusations, but something needs to be done, and fast."
 espionage_events.8.a: "Of the many possible suspects, this one..."
 counterintelligence_operation: "Counterintelligence Operation"
 espionage_events.8.b: "...or this one seem the most likely."
 espionage_events.9.title: "Secrets in our Alliance"
 espionage_events.9.desc: "Ambassadors and diplomatic envoys often double as spies, or at least informants who go beyond their duties to gather information in the country where they are supposed to do honest negotiations. This makes it less than surprising that the [spying_ambassador.GetAdjective] ambassador here in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] has been suspected of involvement in espionage. The challenge now lies in tactfully handling this discovery, since only a thorough cross-examination could ascertain guilt."
 espionage_events.9.a: "We must get to the bottom of this. Arrest the ambassador."
 espionage_events.9.b: "Send a request for him to be replaced."
 espionage_events.9.c: "Just try to cut him off from important affairs."
 espionage_events.10.title: "Ambassador Confesses"
 espionage_events.10.desc: "Once arrested and removed from the comfort of his station, the ambassador we suspected of being complicit in espionage quickly admitted his guilt under interrogation. What's more, his confession indicates the spy network he was part of was more far-reaching than previously suspected. While this is certainly an embarrassment for [spying_ambassador.GetName], they are requesting we resolve the situation amicably by sending the ambassador home immediately.\n\nWhile it's good praxis not to kill or imprison diplomats when it can be avoided, this man has proven himself to be an enemy of our nation. More importantly, he could still have information that is of value to us. Should we let him go to smooth over the situation?"
 espionage_events.10.a: "No. An enemy spy who buckles under pressure is a valuable source."
 imprisoned_ambassador: "Imprisoned Ambassador"
 espionage_events.10.b: "We all spy on each other. We can forgive and forget."
