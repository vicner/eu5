 brahmins_estate_events.2.desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] often aspire to worldly power as well as mere spiritual authority. They have become highly influential of late in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], and many important positions in the administration are now held by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')]. Having become comfortable in their grand appointments, these [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] have approached the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] with a series of demands. They require that certain administrative posts be entrusted to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] by law, that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] customs become mandatory at court, and even that several of the highest ministerial offices be held by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] families in heredity. Outrageous as these demands are, the influence of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] is such that refusing could seriously hinder our ability to govern."
 brahmins_estate_events.2.a: "Accept their authority."
 STATIC_MODIFIER_NAME_religious_court_life: "Clerical Dominance"
 STATIC_MODIFIER_DESC_religious_court_life: "Our court is dominated by the priestly caste and the rules of their scriptures. These strict rules are necessary to keep the favor of our strong clergy but many of our subjects, both high and low, feel alienated by this archaic way of life."
 brahmins_estate_events.2.b: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] should return to their prayers."

 brahmins_estate_events.3.title: "Brahminism"
 brahmins_estate_events.3.desc: "Public sentiment among the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] faithful of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has shifted toward Brahminism, the view that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] caste must be respected and revered as both spiritual and temporal authorities.\n\nThe [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] jealously guard their monopoly on Sanskrit education, keeping as their exclusive domain the ability to preach the Vedas. Their social and religious authority makes them powerful, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetShortName]'s excellent relations with the priestly caste help to keep a stable social order throughout [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

 brahmins_estate_events.4.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are a rising power. They have rallied the popular support of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] population through their position as the divinely-ordained priestly caste, and occupy several key positions within the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] administration."

 brahmins_estate_events.5.title: "Declining Power of the Brāhmaṇa"
 brahmins_estate_events.5.desc: "More than any other caste, the influence of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] is dependent on their standing with the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] faithful. It has been hard to determine a precise cause but they have come to be seen less as the custodians of Vedic doctrine and more as rich and corrupted intrigue-makers.\n\nCombined with poor political maneuvering and lack of favor in the eyes of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] have been losing both power and influence."
 brahmins_estate_events.5.a: "Okay."

 brahmins_estate_events.6.desc: "The state's relations with the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] caste have reached breaking point. Pujaris openly condemn [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetShortName] during ceremonies, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] families refuse to cooperate in the rule of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] subjects.\n\nA recent religious faux-pas on the part of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] has tipped mere outrage into outright rebellion. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] have incited the people to rise against our rule!"
 brahmins_estate_events.6.a: "Okay."

 brahmins_estate_events.7.desc: "The city of [brahmin_trade_province.GetName] is an important regional trade hub for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. It is visited often by Muslim traders from Gujarat, Arabia, and Persia, and [brahmin_trade_province.GetName] has profited from strong commercial connections with these merchants.\n\n[brahmin_trade_province.GetNameWithNoTooltip] has come to be administered by a group of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] clerics whose influence has been felt at every level of society. They have enacted a series of policies and created a social atmosphere that is far from friendly from the perspective of visiting Muslim traders. As a result, many of these alienated traders have decided to take their business elsewhere.\n\n[brahmin_trade_province.GetNameWithNoTooltip] at risk of losing its status as a trade hub if something is not done to attract commerce back to the city."
 brahmins_estate_events.7.a: "The troubles of low-caste merchants are not our concern."

 brahmins_estate_events.9.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] have traditionally had a monopoly on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjective] religious authority, but occasionally religious movements emerge that challenge Brahminism. Such movements are becoming popular throughout [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] in spite of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] efforts to suppress them.\n\nExponents of popular religion argue that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] have wiped off the sacred marks from their foreheads and eschewed their spiritual responsibilities in order to occupy seats of temporal power and mete out injustice to the poor. They declare that selfless devotion is the only path to salvation, a virtue that can be attained by any sufficiently fervent [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] person.\n\nA group of influential [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] have approached the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] pleading for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerHis] aid in restoring public confidence in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] authority and suppressing non-[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetReligion.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] movements."

 brahmins_estate_events.10.desc: "The court of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has become embroiled in a conflict between the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] and the military castes. In the wake of these rising tensions, the matter of fort stewardship has risen to our attention. The fort of [brahmin_fort_province.GetName], currently held by a particularly contentious commandant, lies in a province where the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] are gaining influence of their own.\n\nForeseeing the potential for tensions to break out into hostilities, it may be wise to transfer control of this important fort from the contentious general to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')]. Though less adept than military men at siegecraft, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] are at least loyal to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle].\n\nAlternatively, the commandant could be persuaded to change his attitude in exchange for the retention of his privileges in [brahmin_fort_province.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 brahmins_estate_events.10.a: "Hand over the fort to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')]."
