 nobles_estate_events.1.title: "Noble Birth"
 nobles_estate_events.1.desc: "Many of the families of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] gained their current positions due to the actions of a forefather who served the state in times of war. For most of their sons, a life in the military is therefore the only imaginable career. With the modernization of the army, however, common officers are no longer entirely unusual. Members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] have now approached us, asking that we guarantee what they feel is a right of their class. No man should be able to serve as a commander in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] armies who is not of noble birth!"
 nobles_estate_events.1.a: "Guarantee their right to command our armies."
 nobles_estate_events.1.b: "We cannot commit to such promises."
 nobles_estate_events.2.title: "Advancement of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')]"
 nobles_estate_events.2.desc: "The state is not the sole source of influence in our country. Over the last few decades, a charismatic champion of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] has successfully managed to increase the power of the leading families of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] over most of the institutions of our country.\n\nContacts and privileges can be powerful things, especially when combined with ambition."

 nobles_estate_events.3.title: "Encroachment of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] in [noble_encroachment.GetNameWithNoTooltip]"
 nobles_estate_events.3.desc: "It is difficult to monitor everyone everywhere all the time, and the boundaries between individual land properties are often grounded in old traditions or documents which were written when the landscape may have looked quite different. For someone with the right resources, this can be exploited. A number of prominent families of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] have used their considerable influence in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] to get away with expanding their properties in [noble_encroachment.GetName] considerably. If we want to protect the property of the state, we must act soon."
 nobles_estate_events.3.a: "$common_string_let_it_slide$"
 nobles_estate_events.3.b: "Demand that the land be returned."
 nobles_estate_events.4.title: "Tyrannical [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')]"
 nobles_estate_events.4.desc: "A representative of the people living in an area dominated by one of the most prominent families of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] has approached the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] today, imploring the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] to take action against what he claims are systematic abuses of power against the people there. As the ruler of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], [target_character.GetName] has a responsibility to protect [target_character.GetHerHis] people. Not doing so will make us appear weak, and may harm the long-term growth of the province. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] would likely not take kindly to chastising such a powerful member of their ranks, however."
 nobles_estate_events.4.a: "Turn a blind eye to these abuses."
 nobles_estate_events.4.b: "Chastise the landowner."
 nobles_estate_events.5.title: "Declining Power of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')]"
 nobles_estate_events.5.desc: "As both influential land owners and the traditional warrior class in our state, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] have not fared well lately. Through a combination of excessive infighting and poorly coordinated power plays, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] have lost influence in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and many have retired to their properties in the countryside."
 nobles_estate_events.5.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('common_string_ok')]"
 nobles_estate_events.6.title: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] Demand Stricter Sumptuary Laws"
 nobles_estate_events.6.desc: "Expensive clothes, great banquettes, and impressive palaces are some of the most visible symbols of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')], but the degree to which one family has money to spend on such things can vary greatly. In some cases, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] of our country are able to spend just as lavishly, if not more so, than the average noble. While there are old rules and traditions restricting such things for those of less noble birth, these laws are difficult to enforce efficiently. This is unacceptable to the powerful [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] of our country, who are now demanding that we update our laws on what an outsider can and cannot wear. They are now suggesting that we levy a number of heavy fines against anyone ostentatiously trying to rise above their betters."
 nobles_estate_events.6.a: "Bend to the wishes of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')]."
 nobles_estate_events.6.b: "Refuse to obey the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')]."
 nobles_estate_events.7.title: "The Levée"
 nobles_estate_events.7.desc: "In time, many of the everyday occurrences in the life of [target_character.GetName] and [target_character.GetHerHis] predecessors have become the subject of a ceremony. Being able to attend the bedroom of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] as [target_character.GetSheHe] dresses, for instance, is considered by many to be the best way to gain [target_character.GetHerHis] ear. An elaborate court life will certainly limit the power of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] to plot against us in their countryside properties, but it could also prove to be quite expensive. Entirely denying them the right to be part of the daily life of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], on the other hand, would limit their influence, but the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] would likely resent it."
 nobles_estate_events.7.a: "Host an elaborate and lengthy ceremony for the most influential individuals."
 nobles_estate_events.7.b: "We have no need for such things."
 nobles_estate_events.8.title: "Deteriorating Relations with the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')]"
 nobles_estate_events.8.desc: "Relations between the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] could hardly be worse. The great sense of distrust is rendered plainly visible by the almost deserted [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], as most prominent families keep to their countryside manors. Unless we do something soon, state authority will deteriorate in the areas controlled by the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')], but any demands from the state will likely be met with arms in hand at this point."
 nobles_estate_events.8.a: "$common_string_leave_them_be$"
 nobles_estate_events.8.b: "Force the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] to accept state authority."
 nobles_estate_events.9.title: "Insubordinate [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')]"
 nobles_estate_events.9.desc: "None of our subjects are more associated with war than the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')]. Generations ago, their families served us or the states before us and won their current status on the field of battle. Ever since then, most of them have kept their old traditions alive, training for a life in the field and making connections with others of the same inclination.\n\nThe current state of affairs in our country, however, has left us with few members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] willing to fight our battles. Insubordination has become widespread among our higher ranking officers, and we have good reason to suspect more than a few of them hope for an unsuccessful war."
 nobles_estate_events.9.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.Custom('common_string_negative')]"
 nobles_estate_events.9.b: "It is high time we replaced them with men of true ability."
 nobles_estate_events.10.title: "Growth of the Administration"
 nobles_estate_events.10.desc: "As the state and its bureaucracy grow, there is an ever-increasing need for people to oversee and administrate various lands and functions. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] expect to be first in line when government offices are being handed out, while the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] claim that we should appoint men according to individual merit.\n\nThe unexpected death of a trusted secretary has left a vacant position to be filled at the center of this conflict, with the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')] supporting one candidate and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] expecting us to pick another. While both candidates are talented men, this has to be a political decision."
 nobles_estate_events.10.a: "With a great pedigree come great abilities."
 nobles_estate_events.10.b: "Self-made men are what we need to run this country."
 nobles_estate_events.10.c: "Let us turn to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] instead."
 nobles_estate_events.11.title: "Tradition of Service"
 nobles_estate_events.11.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] have a long tradition of service to the state both as military leaders or, more recently, as dependable administrators. In a state where the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] are as strongly entrenched and loyal as ours, this means that from time to time nobles of great talent and loyalty will emerge to lead the country to greatness."
