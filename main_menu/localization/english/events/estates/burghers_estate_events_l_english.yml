 burghers_estate_events.1.desc: "The status of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] does not rest on the same old traditions as those of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] or the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')]. Instead, they have had to make their own fortunes by working diligently and then risking their profits to again expand their businesses. As a rule, however, this has gone very well for them lately. While not as prestigious, business is in many ways the backbone of our economy, and, through their control of coin, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')] have managed to increase their power over our country."

 burghers_estate_events.2.title: "Robber Barons"
 burghers_estate_events.2.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] are concerned with the great influence of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] in our state. They claim that many lower members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] are disregarding the peace and laws of the land, using their positions of power and the lands that they hold to impose unreasonable tolls and taxes for passing traders. Some are even said to attack and waylay merchants, robbing or extorting them.\n\nRepresentatives of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')] now claim that the economic development of our country is held back by these excesses. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')], on the other hand, argue that they are simply charging reasonable fees for the use of their roads and property. Some among them are willing to give the state a share of the money that they take."
 burghers_estate_events.2.a: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] are only taking what is within their rights."
 burghers_estate_events.2.b: "We must curb such excesses!"
 burghers_estate_events.3.title: "Decline of the Merchant Classes"
 burghers_estate_events.3.desc: "Without the old privileges and pedigrees of other factions, the status and influence of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] is rarely quite as secure as that of those born into power. Lately, a combination of financial misfortune and misdirected political ambitions has resulted in a loss of power and influence for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

 burghers_estate_events.4.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] of [growing_city.GetName], an increasingly important trading [growing_city.GetRank.GetName], have approached the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] today, asking to be granted greater powers in order to make the region thrive without the hindrance of many of our normal taxes. Should we provide them with these means to grow, they assure us that the economy of the area would quickly improve, resulting in more wealth for the state."
 burghers_estate_events.4.a: "We shall accept their petition."
 burghers_estate_events.4.b: "We must reject their petition."

 burghers_estate_events.5.title: "Immoral Prices"
 burghers_estate_events.5.desc: "Wheat prices are notoriously unstable, as anything from the weather where it is grown to incidents hurting its distribution can suddenly cause the price to rise significantly.\n\nAs a result of one such sudden change, there is currently an acute shortage of wheat in many of our larger cities. Desperate to feed themselves, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] are directing their anger at the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')], who they feel are exploiting this situation in order to overcharge for their wares.\n\nThe merchants themselves, on the other hand, claim that these prices are a natural result of the shortage, and that there simply is not enough bread to go around."
 burghers_estate_events.5.a: "We shall force the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] to lower their prices."
 burghers_estate_events.5.b: "We should not meddle in these things."

 burghers_estate_events.6.title: "Parallel Authority"
 burghers_estate_events.6.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] are not the sole authority within their cities, as the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] also have a strong presence in most big cities that dates back to each town's initial founding. Conflicts sometimes arise when the councils of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')] implement rules that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] disapprove of.\n\nSuch conflicts have become more and more commonplace and members of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')] are openly acting in defiance of the various rules that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')] have agreed upon in their cities. Delegates from various cities dominated by the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')] are now urging us to clarify the situation."
 burghers_estate_events.6.a: "We must side with the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')]."
 burghers_estate_events.6.b: "We must side with the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('clergy_estate')]."

 burghers_estate_events.7.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] feel that they are unduly taxed and regulated, keeping in mind the great importance of their work for our country. Tolls, taxes, and various tariffs are holding them back from being able to accomplish even greater things, and they will not hesitate to use all of their influence to abolish such restrictions."
 burghers_estate_events.7.a: "Let us remove these obstacles!"
 burghers_estate_events.7.b: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')] need to know their place!"
 burghers_estate_events.8.title: "Hurtful Trade Policies"
 burghers_estate_events.8.desc: "The interests of prominent merchant households are being hurt by our repressive trade policies toward other countries. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] support these families and have now petitioned us to compensate them by at least easing some other restrictions on trade to compensate for their loss of income."
 burghers_estate_events.8.a: "We must support the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')]."
 burghers_estate_events.8.b: "We cannot let our trade policy be dictated by these peddlers."
 burghers_estate_events.9.title: "Cottage Industry"
 burghers_estate_events.9.desc: "Economic development is not always without conflict. It seems that rich merchants in some of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')]-dominated cities have been attempting to bypass various guild privileges by outsourcing work to the homes of families living outside of the city. The fact that this 'Putting-out System' has been a very profitable strategy only further enflames the anger of the artisans in the city, who feel that their ancient rights have been trampled upon and that the carefully managed prices of their products will suffer. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] artisans now turn to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] to defend their privileges, as the city council has been unable to quash competition from outside the city."
 burghers_estate_events.9.a: "We cannot stand in the way of progress."
 burghers_estate_events.9.b: "We must safeguard guild privileges."
 burghers_estate_events.10.title: "Social Mobility"
 burghers_estate_events.10.desc: "The growing power of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] has led to individuals from within their ranks seeking their fortunes in areas traditionally dominated by other groups. The sons of mid to low prominence families of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')] now have the education and the ambition to match the more privileged classes and, as a result, an increasing number of them are now being employed as administrators, lawyers, and officers, as well as in other positions traditionally dominated by another estate. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')] still feel that they are being unduly held back by the archaic rights and privileges of another era, but their adversaries are growing very weary of the current 'unnatural' social mobility.\n\nUnless we do something, we risk losing the support of the privileged classes, but if we withdraw our support from the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')] at this juncture, it will likely have grave consequences for our relations with them."
 burghers_estate_events.10.a: "We must not stand in the way of these new men."
 burghers_estate_events.10.b: "We must protect the ancient rights of the other estates."
 burghers_estate_events.11.title: "Growth of the Economy"
 burghers_estate_events.11.desc: "Our policy of cooperation with the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] has come to bear fruit in the form of economic development in many fields. The cities of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] are prospering and our influence in international trade is growing rapidly."

 burghers_estate_events.12.title: "The Risks of Trade"
 burghers_estate_events.12.desc: "Trade over large distances can be risky, if profitable. The weather, brigands, and pirates remain a threat on land as well as on the water.\n\nNormally, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] can cope with a certain amount of mishaps, and they have their own ways to protect themselves and insure their cargo.\n\nLately, however, things have been going badly for a large number of merchant families, and some are on the brink of bankruptcy. It may be prudent to offer some financial compensation to get them back on their feet."
 burghers_estate_events.12.a: "Compensate the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')]."
 burghers_estate_events.12.b: "They knew what they were getting into."
 burghers_estate_events.13.title: "Urbanization"
 burghers_estate_events.13.desc: "While only a small portion of our population lives in the cities, the growing prosperity of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] is attracting an increasing number of people from the countryside. Some cities are growing so quickly that existing problems in terms of sanitation and overcrowding have gone from troubling to catastrophic, according to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')]. The poor have taken up residence outside the city walls, where filthy suburbs have sprung up and disease thrives.\n\nThe [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')] find the situation intolerable and are now requesting that the state step in to provide help, both in terms of resources and the enforcement of rules outside of the walls. They claim that only government intervention can turn this virulent urbanization into a positive change."
 burghers_estate_events.13.a: "We must attempt to improve conditions."
 burghers_estate_events.13.b: "This is nothing unusual. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('burghers_estate')] can handle it."
 burghers_estate_events.14.title: "Economic Policy"
 burghers_estate_events.14.desc: "As the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] grow in power, their calls for fewer trade regulations and taxes become more and more frequent. Many feel that our country has an old-fashioned and repressive trade policy, and that we would benefit from reducing the amount of taxes and tolls that hinder commerce."
 burghers_estate_events.14.a: "Reduce [ShowSocietyDirectionName('mercantilism')]."
 burghers_estate_events.14.b: "Refuse to interfere with [ShowSocietyDirectionName('free_trade')]."
 burghers_estate_events.15.t: "Big Guild Falls Short"
 burghers_estate_events.15.desc: "A guild in [golden_parachute_location.GetName] has found itself with insufficient funds to cover the damages of a shipment lost at sea and is facing the possibility of disbandment.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, this is hardly a concern of the state, but the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] are asking for a bailout, demanding that the government pay for the loss in order to maintain the stability of the region. Allowing the guild to close could greatly upset the social order of [golden_parachute_location.GetNameWithNoTooltip]."
 burghers_estate_events.15.a: "The nation will not meddle in private business."
 burghers_estate_events.15.b: "We shall bail them out. The welfare of the tradesmen is the welfare of the nation."
 burghers_estate_events.15.c: "Agree to fund the guild, if the guild comes under national control."
