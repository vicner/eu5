His latest publications have also become more radical, trying to refute the accusations of heresy in them. He even started making allegations about his ability to perform miracles, which would undoubtedly show that he is being guided by God if they were true. To prove these alleged miracles, he was challenged to pass the trial of fire, a test in which he would have to walk through burning fire. If he is indeed capable of miracles and guided by God, fire would not be able to burn him and he would pass through it unscathed.\n\nOn the date assigned for the trial, a huge crowd assembled in the main square, eager to see the outcome. Expectation and nervousness could be felt in the air, and as time went on without anything starting the mood of the crowd went increasingly sour.
