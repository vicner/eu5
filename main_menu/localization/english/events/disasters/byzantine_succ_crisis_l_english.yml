  byzantine_succ_crisis.11.historical_info: "During the Byzantine civil war of 1341, the empire was divided between the regency for the young John V Palaiologos and the claimant John VI Kantakouzenos. The conflict drew in Venice and Genoa, who used the war to advance their competing commercial interests. Genoa supported the pretender, hoping to secure trade dominance in the Black Sea and was rewarded with privileges and naval influence, particularly in Galata. Venice, determined to counter Genoese expansion, backed the regency. This turned the would-be civil war into a proxy struggle between the two maritime republics, further weakening Byzantium and deepening its dependence on foreign powers for naval and commercial matters."
