  french_wars_religion.1.historical_info: "The French Wars of Religion were a series of violent conflicts between the Catholic majority and the Protestant Huguenots, driven by religious divisions and political ambition. Influential noble families, such as the Guise and Bourbon, exploited the chaos to gain power. The wars led to brutal massacres, shifting alliances, and widespread devastation. Royal authority weakened, but stability began to return when Henry IV, a former Protestant, converted to Catholicism and issued the Edict of Nantes, granting religious tolerance to the Huguenots. This compromise helped unify France and brought an end to decades of turmoil."

  french_wars_religion.4.historical_info: "The phrase #italic Paris is worth a mass#! refers to an event in French history involving Henry IV, a Protestant who converted to Catholicism in 1593 to secure his claim to the French throne. France, deeply divided by religious wars between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots), required a Catholic monarch to maintain stability and legitimacy. Henry, recognizing this, converted and famously justified his decision with the pragmatic statement, suggesting that ruling France and bringing peace was more important than personal religious adherence. This act paved the way for his reign and the eventual Edict of Nantes in 1598, which granted religious tolerance to Protestants."
