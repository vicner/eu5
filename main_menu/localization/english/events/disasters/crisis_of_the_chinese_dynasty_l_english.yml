Various aristocrats and officials that once laid in decadence used to find loopholes to avoid paying their taxes, which eventually led to the erosion of the central government.\n\nThe bold measures put in place under [target_character.GetName] have resulted to renewed income reaching the treasury from various corners that now recognize our authority."
