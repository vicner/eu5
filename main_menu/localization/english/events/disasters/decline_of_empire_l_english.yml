  decline_of_empire.1.title: "Decline of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongNameWithNoTooltip]"
  decline_of_empire.1.desc: "As the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] stretches thin, cracks begin to show. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] is paralyzed under weak leadership, its halls filled with corruption and indecision. Distant provinces, even in [target_region.GetName], chafe under neglect, while discontent spreads through the heartlands. Whispers of rebellion echo in the streets, and the once-mighty bureaucracy under [target_character.GetName] struggles to maintain control.\n\nThe [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] teeters on the brink. The people grow restless, famine and economic decline fuel their anger, and ambitious rivals see weakness. If order is not restored, collapse is inevitable. The coming years will test our resilience like never before. That which was built with blood and toil now faces total ruin, as time pits itself against yet another [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."
  decline_of_empire.1.a: "Down come the stars, along with our hearts."
  during_decline_of_empire_explanation_tt: "During this [disaster|e], [provinces|e] with [non_accepted_culture|e] [pops|e] or low [control|e] may seek independence. Meanwhile, foreign rivals may exploit our weakness to expand their borders."

  decline_of_empire.2.title: "End of the Decline"
  decline_of_empire.2.desc: "As the fires of crisis fade, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] begins to rebuild. Order has been restored, and the fractures that once threatened to tear the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] apart have been mended. Whether through strengthening control or embracing cultural unity, the chaos that gripped our people has been subdued.\n\nThe whispers of rebellion grow silent, once-restless provinces return to the fold, and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] reasserts its authority. Though scars remain, the worst has passed. We have successfully weathered the storm and emerged, if not unscathed, then at least unbroken."
  decline_of_empire.2.a: "The worst is behind us!"
  pops_accepted_or_primary_culture_gain_10_satisfaction_home_region_tt: "Every [pop|e] of [primary_culture|e] or [accepted_culture|e] in the [target_region.GetName] [region|e] will gain [ShowNamedValue('pop_satisfaction_mild_bonus')|+=2%] [pop_satisfaction|e]"

  decline_of_empire.3.title: "The Fires of Independence"
  decline_of_empire.3.desc: "The turmoil that has gripped the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName] has finally borne its inevitable consequence; [target_country.GetName] has broken free. Weakened by internal strife, our grip over the region has loosened, and the local rulers have seized the opportunity to cast off our rule. Their banners fly high, their leaders speak of sovereignty, and their armies stand ready to defend their newfound freedom.\n\nNow, we face a choice; muster what strength remains to crush this rebellion and reclaim what is ours, or accept the loss and turn our focus inward, ensuring the rest of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] does not follow suit."
  decline_of_empire.3.a: "Crush them!"
  decline_of_empire.3.b: "Grant them freedom, for now."
  target_country_allowed_to_slip_from_grasp_tt: "[target_country.GetNameWithNoTooltip] will proclaim a bloodless independence.\nWe will #R lose#! our [cores|e] in their [locations|e]"

  decline_of_empire.4.desc: "Amid the chaos that has gripped our lands, [target_country.GetName] has seized the moment and declared its independence. Our weakened authority has proven insufficient to hold their unruly provinces together, and now the rebellion stands defiant. Their forces rally under their own banner, and their leaders boldly claim autonomy, abandoning our rule for good.\n\nThe question of granting them independence is a difficult topic due to our current predicament. Caving in to their demands may see our claim on their lands disappear, but it would also ensure our attention may be focused to more pressing matters elsewhere."
  decline_of_empire.4.a: "They have forgotten who they serve, to arms!"
  decline_of_empire.4.b: "We care not about petty squabbles of distant [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('peasants_estate')]."

  decline_of_empire.5.title: "A Dying Empire"
  decline_of_empire.5.desc: "Our neighbors in [target_country.GetName] are paralyzed by crisis and decline, their [target_country.GetFlavorRank] collapsing under rebellion and disorder. Their armies are stretched thin, their provinces slip from their grasp, and their leaders struggle to hold their [target_country.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] together. With their forces divided and their attention elsewhere, we have a rare opportunity. A swift campaign could secure key territories before they recover — but if we act too late, we may face a costly war."
  decline_of_empire.5.a: "Strike while the iron is hot!"
  decline_of_empire.5.b: "We will bide our time, for now."

  decline_of_empire.6.title: "Demands of the People"
  decline_of_empire.6.desc: "In the wake of the turmoil, the [target_culture.GetName] people have begun to voice their demands for greater autonomy. The unrest that has swept through the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] has fueled their desire for more control over their own affairs, and they now call for reforms that would grant them greater independence from our central rule.\n\nDenying their request could prove dangerous! Resentment is rising, and the seeds of rebellion are being sown. Should we ignore their plea, we risk alienating a portion of our population and sparking yet more unrest across the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]. Alternatively, offering concessions could ease tensions and maintain stability, but it may come at the cost of weakening our control."
  decline_of_empire.6.a: "Grant them some autonomy."
  decline_of_empire.6.b: "They forget their place!"
  explain_decline_of_empires_events.6_tt: "Reducing our [control|e] across these [locations|e] will hurt our overall control in the short term. However, increases the [pop_satisfaction|e] of our [target_culture.GetNameWithNoTooltip] [pops|e] may result in long-term [control|e] gains"
