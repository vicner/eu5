The pretenders grow in strength, and soon they may strike at the heart of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetGovernmentType.GetName]. Desperate times call for allies, and so we may yet send a messenger to [target_country.GetName], pleading for aid.

The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] that once supported our throne have been forced to reckon with the dangers posed by the growing rebellion. Many among the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] recognize that their lands and privileges are bound to the continuation of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetAdjective] line, and thus, a faction has rallied to our defense. With their personal retinues and loyal bannermen, they offer support against the pretenders forces. However, in return they expect greater influence over our governance."

 succession_crisis.10.desc: "Even as our people are divided on their support for the [succession_crisis_pretender_scope.GetName], the faithful look to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWith('clergy_estate')] for guidance. Recognizing the danger posed by a fractured [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], their leaders have now stepped forth, offering their support.\n\nIn exchange for a new privilege, their preachers will denounce the pretender as a usurper, calling upon the people to reaffirm their loyalty to [target_character1.GetName].

Viewing the crisis as a threat to trade and prosperity, they propose a solution.\n\nAccording to their most influential and rebellious members, they could easily be placated to switch sides. In return, they demand new privileges, establishing a strong base of support in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] of [target_character1.GetName].
