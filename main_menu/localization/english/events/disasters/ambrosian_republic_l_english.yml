 ambrosian_republic.2.desc: "With the throne of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] left vacant, both the [GetCountry('FRA').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] of [GetCountry('FRA').GetName] and the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetLeaderCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] of [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetLeaderCountry.GetName] as Emperor of the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetName] are openly discussing their claims to the throne. The [GetCountry('FRA').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] claim is predicated on marriage ties to the old [ShowDynastyName('visconti_dynasty')] dynasty. Though the claim is not strong, [GetCountry('FRA').GetNameWithNoTooltip] has had designs on [ShowRegionName('italy_region')] for quite some time and there are few with the strength to resist the [GetCountry('FRA').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] [GetCountry('FRA').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle]. The Emperor meanwhile contends that in the absence of a clear heir, the title of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] is to be conferred upon the Emperor by Imperial law."
 ambrosian_republic.2.a: "We must be prepared to defend our liberty."

 ambrosian_republic.3.desc: "[GetCountry('MLO').GetName] has fallen into political chaos. The throne is vacant and an upstart [GetCountry('MLO').GetGovernment.GetGovernmentType.GetName] strives in vain to establish order. This would be an excellent time to enforce our claim to their title, predicated on our marriage ties to the now extinct House of [ShowDynastyName('visconti_dynasty')]."

 ambrosian_republic.4.desc: "[GetCountry('MLO').GetName] has fallen into political chaos. The throne is vacant and an upstart [GetCountry('MLO').GetGovernment.GetGovernmentType.GetName] strives in vain to establish order. By Imperial law, their title ought to pass to the Emperor [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerselfHimself] when the line of [GetCountry('MLO').GetNameWithNoTooltip] is extinguished. If we wish to impose this law and claim [GetCountry('MLO').GetNameWithNoTooltip] for ourselves, we must act quickly to depose the so-called Golden Ambrosian Republic."

 ambrosian_republic.5.title.fallback: "A Proposition for a General"
 ambrosian_republic.5.desc: "[target_character.GetName] is one of the greatest military generals of our time and a prominent condottieri leader. It is most unfortunate that we find ourselves at odds with [target_character.GetHerHim] in our struggles to suppress rebels. [target_character.GetLastNameWithNoTooltip] is popular among the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people, however, and even has a claim to the throne.\n\nA faction within the divided government has written to [target_character.GetHerHim] with a generous offer: if [target_character.GetSheHe] abandons all contact with our enemies and joins our cause, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] would offer [target_character.GetHerHim] much land as well as a position as a Captain and Defender. [target_character.GetLastNameWithNoTooltip] could be a great asset to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank], but many question whether [target_character.GetHerHis] loyalty to us will trump [target_character.GetHerHis] personal ambition."
 ambrosian_republic.5.a: "We shall appoint [target_character.GetHerHim] commander of our armies."
 ambrosian_republic.5.b: "We cannot risk another potential tyrant!"

 ambrosian_republic.6.desc: "[target_character.GetName] has many rivals within the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName]. The more idealistic and scholarly politicians who founded the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] suspect [target_character.GetHerHim] of conspiring to seize the throne, while more pragmatic politicians resent [target_character.GetHerHis] popularity among the people.\n\n[target_character.GetLastNameWithNoTooltip] has recently learned of a plot to deprive [target_character.GetHerHim] of [target_character.GetHerHis] military command and eject [target_character.GetHerHim] from [target_character.GetHerHis] position in government. Outraged, [target_character.GetLastNameWithNoTooltip] issues an ultimatum to the state: accept [target_character.GetHerHis] absolute military rule, or face [target_character.GetHerHim] once again on the field of battle."
 ambrosian_republic.6.a: "Impose military rule under [target_character.GetLastNameWithNoTooltip]."

 ambrosian_republic.7.desc: "Ever the ambitious opportunist, [target_character.GetName] has betrayed the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] and declared himself the rightful ruler of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]! [target_character.GetHerHis|U] popularity with the people and iron grip over both the army and the mechanisms of the state make it so that defiance to [target_character.GetHerHis] rule seems like a doomed prospect. Perhaps we must accept the establishment of [target_character.GetHerHis] monarchy. Or perhaps liberty is worth any price."
 ambrosian_republic.7.a: "All hail [target_character.GetLastNameWithNoTooltip]!"
 ambrosian_republic.7.b: "Unacceptable! We will fight [target_character.GetHerHim] if we must."
 ambrosian_republic.7.c: "Never! Let us restore the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] as the founders intended."
