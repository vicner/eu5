  time_of_troubles.1.title: "The [ShowDisasterNameWithNoTooltip('time_of_troubles')]"
  time_of_troubles.1.desc: "The air grows heavy with despair as whispers of rebellion spread like wildfire. The once-mighty [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] falters under the weight of weak leadership and failing harvests. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')], restless and emboldened, plot against the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle], while the peasantry, starving and desperate, rise in revolt. Foreign powers circle like vultures, eager to exploit the chaos. As shadows gather over the land, the [ShowDisasterName('time_of_troubles')] begins, a tumultuous era that will test the mettle and resilience of the people. Will the nation endure, or will it be swept away in the storm of disorder?"
  time_of_troubles.1.historical_info: "The Time of Troubles stretched from the death of the last Tsar of the 700-year-old Rurik dynasty, Feodor Ivanovich, in 1598, and the ascension of Mikhail Fyodorovich of the Romanov dynasty in 1613. Famine, plague, public unrest and the appearance of false claimants plunged the country into a decade of turmoil as neighboring powers like Sweden and Poland saw their chance to interfere."
  time_of_troubles.1.a: "Our tenacity will see us through."

  time_of_troubles.2.title: "Insanity"
  time_of_troubles.2.desc: "Over the last couple of months, the erratic behavior of [target_character.GetShortName] has become an increasing concern for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetCourtTitle] and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] as a whole. What started as minor eccentricities has escalated into unpredictable and often disruptive actions that leave advisors and courtiers alike in a state of unease.\n\nSome whisper in hushed tones that [target_character.GetSheHe] has completely lost [target_character.GetHerHis] sanity, pointing to strange outbursts, bizarre decisions, and an apparent detachment from reality. The question now lingers heavily over the nation: how long can this instability persist before it begins to unravel the fabric of governance?"
  time_of_troubles.2.a: "Let [target_character.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] cling to power."
  time_of_troubles.2.b: "We will trust the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateNameWithNoTooltip('nobles_estate')] that back [target_character_2.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]!"

  time_of_troubles.3.title: "The Forbidden Years"
  time_of_troubles.3.desc: "Our great [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] is gripped tightly by internal forces with great influence. Those between us that seek to further their fortunes, do so by applying frequent pressure to [target_character.GetName], in an effort to guide [target_character.GetHerHis] policy-making decisions.\n\nRecently, a group consisting of powerful [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] have stepped forth, demanding an unprecedented reduction to the rights of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')]. Their justification revolves around the apparent need to stabilize landholdings during a time of financial struggle. Such a measure will certainly ripple through our society, shaping the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] for years to come."
  time_of_troubles.3.a: "Approve the measure."
  time_of_troubles.3.b: "This is a betrayal to our people!"
  time_of_troubles.3.historical_info: "The enserfment of Russian peasants in the 16th century was a gradual process driven by state policies and socioeconomic changes. Initially, peasants had some freedom to move between estates, particularly around the agricultural season. However, in 1581, Ivan IV introduced the #italic Forbidden Years#! (zapovednye leta), temporarily restricting peasant movement to stabilize tax revenues and secure labor for the landowners. Unfortunately, over time these measures became permanent."

  time_of_troubles.4.title: "Famine Descends Upon Us"
  time_of_troubles.4.desc: "The recent years have had a terrible effect to many [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')]. Brigands, plagues and economic instability terrorizes the land. Now, failed harvests and unseasonable weather seem to have given rise to a terrible famine in [target_area.GetName]. Widespread starvation will soon follow, with our advisors projecting many dead from this misfortune.\n\nDesperate refugees pour into [target_province.GetName], including [target_location.GetName], overwhelming local resources and spreading chaos. The sheer scale of the disaster exacerbates economic collapse and deepens unrest, creating fertile ground for uprisings across the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]."

  time_of_troubles.5.title: "The Terror of Brigands"
  time_of_troubles.5.desc: "Recent famines and devastating outbreaks of plague have plunged much of the country into chaos, leaving entire areas at the mercy of their fortune. In [target_area.GetName], the collapse of order has transformed the area into a lawless wasteland.\n\nBands of armed brigands now roam the countryside unchecked, looting villages, ambushing travelers, and terrorizing the already desperate local population. The absence of authority has left the people to fend for themselves, with little hope of relief as the rest of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] struggles to recover from its own turmoil."
  time_of_troubles.5.a: "Let them do as they please."

This [target_character_2.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] quickly attracted supporters throughout the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank] and especially among our rivals.\n\nDuring the recent months, [target_character_2.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] crossed the border into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] together with a force of foreign and local troops. It seems [target_character_2.GetSheHe] already has strong support from those who wish to see us fall."
  time_of_troubles.6.historical_info: "In 1604, during Russia's chaotic Time of Troubles, a mysterious figure emerged claiming to be Dmitry, the long-dead son of Ivan the Terrible. This 'False Dmitry', backed by Polish nobles and the Catholic Church, swept through Russia with promises of stability. Many believed him, desperate for order amid famine and power struggles. Eventually he would be crowned tsar in 1605, albeit his reign was brief. His foreign supporters and lavish reforms alienated Moscow's elite. Just a year later, a violent coup ended his life. The legend of False Dmitry persisted, however, spawning more pretenders as Russia spiraled deeper into turmoil."

Farmers that depend on agricultural output have all but lost their dignity and what little social standing they once had. Angered mobs now roam the streets in key settlements across [target_area.GetName], expressing their dissatisfaction with the rule of [target_character.GetName] while threatening to openly revolt."

[target_character_3.GetSheHe|U] has sent envoys seeking our aid, promising to strike a deadly blow against our foe. Backing this cause could weaken our rival, but it may provoke a fierce response from [target_location.GetName]. Should we gamble on [target_character_3.GetHerHis] success?"
