  english_civil_war.251.historical_info: "The English Civil War (1642-1651) stemmed from conflicts between King Charles I and the Parliament over royal authority, taxation, and religious reforms. Charles's autocratic rule, dismissal of procedures, and imposition of unpopular policies fueled widespread discontent.\n\nThe war pitted Royalists (supporters of the monarchy) against Parliamentarians, advocating constitutional governance. It resulted in the execution of Charles I, the abolition of the monarchy, and the establishment of the Commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell. Ultimately, the conflict reshaped English political structure, weakening the monarchy's power and laying the foundation for modern parliamentary democracy, though tensions persisted until the monarchy's restoration in 1660."
