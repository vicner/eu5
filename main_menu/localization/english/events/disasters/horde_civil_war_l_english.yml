 horde_civil_war.1.desc: "The death of our previous ruler has left the [target_country.GetLongName] in a precarious situation. The new [target_country.Custom('GetRulerOrRegentTitle')] might have assumed the [target_country.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] throne, yet [target_character.GetSheHe] lacks the unity and support of [target_character.GetHerHis] warriors. As such, [scope_pretender.GetName], a warlord within our borders, has started assembling loyalists to challenge [target_character.GetName] for [target_character.GetHerHis] throne..."

 horde_civil_war.2.a: "Only over our dead, rotting bodies!"
 horde_civil_war.2.b: "So are the laws of the steppes."

 horde_civil_war.4.desc.end: "$horde_civil_war.4.desc$\n\nAfter such devastating defeat by the pretender, any further attempts on the [target_country.GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] throne seem to have ceased. Stability has once again returned to [target_country.GetName]."

 horde_civil_war.7.desc: "The conflict between [target_ruler.GetName] and the pretender [target_character.GetName] has put a dent in the efforts to centralize the [target_country.GetName].

 horde_civil_war.9.title: "Trade Collapse"
 horde_civil_war.9.desc: "Usually, the steppes within our [target_country.GetFlavorRank] are safe routes for the [target_country.GetAdjective] traders and their business partners. However, with the escalating hostilities between [target_ruler.GetName] and [target_character.GetName], the caravans have become targets to marauding rebels. Naturally, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')] is less than tolerant of the current situation, and demands compensation."
