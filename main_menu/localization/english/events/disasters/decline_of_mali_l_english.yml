 decline_of_mali.1.desc: "It started unnoticed, but day by day, month by month, year by year, an unease feeling has spread throughout the lands of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetLongName].

How will the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], sitting at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHerHis] court, face this ominous period?"

 decline_of_mali.3.desc: "Amidst the power vacuum, a charismatic individual from [target_location.GetName] steps forward, claiming to be a long-lost relative of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] and the rightful heir to the throne.

 decline_of_mali.4.desc: "The [target_country.GetLongName] was built upon the military victories won by its mighty troops and brave generals. Nowadays, however, incompetent military commanders rise to positions of power, appointed through nepotism or favoritism rather than merit, plaguing the army with deep-rooted factionalism and internal divisions. Loyalties become divided, weakening the effectiveness and unity of the armed forces, and causing further infighting. This has been a significant issue in the province of [target_province.GetName] where incompetent yet influential men of the military gather in [target_location.GetName] to plot against the [target_country.GetFlavorRank]..."

 decline_of_mali.5.desc: "As [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s central authority weakens, disgruntled local rulers and provincial elites begin to challenge the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank]'s control. They believe that their resources and labor are being exploited for the benefit of other regions, while their own economic development is neglected. This perception fosters grievances and bolsters their unrest, making them refuse to pay tribute while demanding to have their local powers rule over their land.

These factions consist of ambitious nobles, advisors, and influential figures who employ manipulation, bribery, and blackmail to gain power, secure their positions, and advance their personal agendas.

However, the general situation of decline has also reached our court, and now more of our counselors have their position not because of their merit and loyalty, but through manipulation, bribery, and nepotism.
