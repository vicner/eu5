 revolutionary_chaos.2.desc: "With new ideas spreading through our nation, lively debates have sprung up surrounding the position of religious minorities in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. While advocates for religious freedom have seized the chance to call for reforms to improve the situation of followers of the [target_location.GetDominantReligion.GetAdjective] faith and other minorities in the country, reactionaries are pushing for a full-scale clampdown against them. Violent clashes are likely if the matter is not handled properly."

 revolutionary_chaos.5.title: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetGovernmentType.GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s Bureaucracy"
 revolutionary_chaos.5.desc: "The years of mismanagement left our centralized government in a very corrupt and bloated state, making it difficult to pass any policies to improve the situation. One of the key revolutionary demands is to decentralize authority and weaken the bureaucracy so as not to stifle the entrepreneurial classes. Of course, such actions will disturb reactionaries, yet inaction might draw the wrath of the enthusiasts of the Revolution."

Reactionaries are everywhere, ever seeking an opportunity to bring the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetGovernmentType.GetName] to fall. This has brought the militantly radical faction led by a certain [target_character.GetName] to power in the National Assembly.

To counteract this, our government elected more conversative members of the old society to guide the fragile [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetGovernmentType.GetName] through the difficult times. These Counter-Revolutionaries, led by [target_character.GetName], have now entrenched themselves in the National Assembly, and try to restore order through the liberal use of diverse execution methods to curb the mindless masses."

However, in the end revolutionary, anti-monarchist sentiment is as strong as ever, and any form of order has been only replaced with undirected mass arrests and executions. Counter-revolutionaries of the National Assembly blame these failures on [target_character.GetName] and demand [target_character.GetHerHis] immediate banishment. Meanwhile, other conversative forces within the assembly claim that [target_character.GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]'s methods are working and accuse the assembly to be filled with revolutionaries.

Through surgical usages of blackmailing, embezzling, and threats of violence, the romanticized ideas of the Revolution are nothing but a macabre joke in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].
