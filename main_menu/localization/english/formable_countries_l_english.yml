 NOL_f_desc: "For too long, the lands of the Northumbrians have been governed by southerners or people from across the sea. It is time for us to take the reins of our nation and reclaim the glory our ancestors once knew. The lords of the North shall rise once more!"
 IRE_f: "Ireland"

 SPA_f: "Spain"
 SPA_f_desc: "Since the defeat of the Visigoths by the [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('muslim')] invasion in the 8th century, Iberia has been the seat of several independent kingdoms. Numerous would-be conquerors have since attempted to unify the region, proclaiming themselves rulers of 'Hispania,' 'Spania,' or — as it is now known — 'Spain.' But it is we who shall finally unify the Peninsula once and for all!"
 ADU_f: "Al-'Andalus"
 ADU_f_desc: "Once all of Iberia was commanded by the glorious Muslim rulers of Al-'Andalus, who brought unparalleled beauty and innovation with their reign. Let us now repudiate the shameful [ShowReligionGroupAdjective('christian')] Reconquista, and retake the rightful lands of our ancestors."
 EGY_f: "Egypt"
 EGY_f_desc: "While the history of Egypt is beyond ancient, it was for vast stretches of time ruled by foreign invaders, not its native souls. Forging a new Egyptian state free from outside interference could restore our legendary Empire, much as the Nile overflows and replenishes the land along its banks."
 KOA_f: "Africa"
 KOA_f_desc: "In days past, the Normans created a Christian kingdom in Africa, bridging both sides of the Mediterranean. But that fledgling nation was decimated, devoured by the enemies of Christ. Now that it is within our reach to do so, it is our duty to recover that territory and bring the glory of our Lord to them once again."
 BEJ_f: "Beja"
 BEJ_f_desc: "Our people have traditionally been divided among several clans and families, some powerful enough to call themselves kingdoms. However, their apparent strength is in actuality extremely fragile. Only a realm that unites all clans under a single banner can bring true power and prosperity to our people!"
 ETH_f: "Ethiopia"
 ETH_f_desc: "The ancient empire of Ethiopia was the spiritual successor to the Aksumite Empire, the legendary home of King Solomon's son, and a stalwart bulwark of the Coptic faith. The fall of that Empire was a tragedy for the Coptic faithful, but the spirit of a unified Ethiopia still lives on, waiting to be revived by a worthy successor — like us!"

 BAV_f_desc: "The once-lofty Duchy of Bavaria was a bastion of economic and diplomatic power, with its enviable location and gifted population.

 BOH_f_desc: "Ever since the Golden Bull of Sicily was granted to Ottokar I in 1212, the lands of [ShowAreaName('bohemia_area')] enjoyed an elevated status within Central [ShowContinentName('europe')].

 SAX_f: "Saxony"
 SAX_f_desc: "The Duchy of Saxony was once an influential stem duchy within the old empire. While its core territories have shifted over time, the title has retained its prestige and renown. If we wish to be recognized as the rightful heir to the Saxon title, we must persuade the Emperor of the [GetInternationalOrganizationType('hre').GetName] to become an elector, a role which will be given to the Duke of Saxony."
 NSA_f: "Nassau"
 NSA_f_desc: "Although the Duchy of Nassau was neither the most stable nor the most famous of its peers, our founding dynasty connects us to many crowned heads of [ShowContinentName('europe')], giving us a strong position from which to claim authority. To make our voice within Germany heard, we must unify the lands of Nassau once and for all and reassert the strength of this dynastic legacy, preventing any further fracturing of our rightful territory."
 MKL_f: "Mecklenburg"
 MKL_f_desc: "With the unification of the Mecklenburgian territories, we can create a new, independent Dukedom within northern Germany. This new state will be able to undo the mistakes of the past, avoiding the fracturing of our territories into multiple sovereign countries and creating a counterbalance to the rivals who covet our lands."
 POM_f: "Pomerania"
 POM_f_desc: "Pomeranian territory occupies a vital position along the Baltic coastline. If we want to profit from our strategic position, and take advantage of being on a busy trade route, we must do away with the old divisions and succession squabbles, and reform a united Pomeranian Duchy."
 PRU_f: "Prussia"

 LVA_f: "Livonia"
 LVA_f_desc: "The lands of Curonia, Livonia, and Estonia were once part of the Livonian Order, who swore to convert their conquered territories to [ShowReligionGroupName('christian')]. While the Order built a functioning state, it did so on the backs of the very people it had conquered, who planted seeds of resentment alongside their crops. Should the Order fail to uphold the order of society, they would be easy enough to replace with a bit of force and Livonian courage."
 GER_f: "Germany"
 GER_f_desc: "Despite the absence of a strong central authority, our nation is prospering. The wealthy Hanseatic League, formed by hundreds of towns in northern Germany, has made our nation incredibly prosperous. Intellectual growth, combined with sea and overland trading, has also helped spur development and transform our country into a wealthy hub of manufacturing and intellectual innovation."

 MSI_f: "Mossi"
 MSI_f_desc: "We are a people deeply devoted to our unique beliefs and traditions, proud of our political acumen and military strength. Yet despite our deeply ingrained culture, our people have failed to unify as a single group, and the consequences of that division have been dire. Only through unity can our people find peace and enjoy prosperity — we must achieve it!"
 MAZ_f: "Mazovia"
 MAZ_f_desc: "Despite being one of the major [ShowCultureGroupName('polish_group')] cultures, the Mazovians are culturally and linguistically distinct from other [ShowCultureGroupNameWithNoTooltip('polish_group')] groups. Given this, it seems fitting for our people to demand the unification of all Mazovian lands under a single ruler, as only that way will we be able to fully demonstrate our unique power and glory to the world."
 KRY_f: "Gilan"
 KRY_f_desc: "Situated on the shores of the [ShowAreaName('caspian_sea_area')] and in the heart of [ShowCultureName('gilak_culture')], Gilan has existed under the shadow of [ShowRegionName('persia_region')] for centuries. The time has come for us to establish its presence on the world stage, and emerge as an independent power."
 RYU_f: "Ryūkyū"
 RYU_f_desc: "Inhabited by the [ShowCultureName('ryukyu_culture')] people and boasting a unique culture and identity, the islands of [ShowAreaName('ryuukyuu_area')] have always been fragmented due to their own nature. However, uniting the kingdoms of the three mountains would build a nation of great prosperity and culture — one that could change the entire course of history."

 MOL_f: "Moldavia"
 MOL_f_desc: "For too long, the Moldovans have lived under different warlords, who in turn were subjects of more powerful rulers.

It is time to reunite our people under the banner of the Bull, and ensure the bright and independent future of our nation."
 SIL_f: "Silesia"
 SIL_f_desc: "Silesia has been divided into Duchies and ruled from foreign capitals for centuries. Like jewels on a broken necklace, each part yearns to be restored to its whole and perfect state. Therefore, the hour has come for Silesia to cast aside foreign rule and quench the fires of internal division, creating a new, unified Silesian nation."
 POL_f: "Poland"
 POL_f_desc: "The kingdom that the Piasts once worked so hard to reunify is now divided and without leadership. There is too much glory in our history and too much promise in our future to allow Poland to remain cut into pieces — we must strive to unite the Polish people and create a nation that will shine even brighter than our kingdoms of the past!"

 UKR_f: "Ruthenia"
 UKR_f_desc: "Centuries ago, the land of the Rus' was united under a single banner and ruled from the legendary city of [ShowLocationName('kyiv')]. But the Mongol hordes advanced from the great steppe, pillaging and burning as they went. Even great [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('kyiv')] itself could not avoid this fate. In terror, our people fled north into the hinterlands we today call Russia.\nNow a new, arrogant northern city is on the rise. Its ruler envisions a new Rus' — A Rus' centered in [ShowLocationName('moscow')] and not [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('kyiv')]. But we Ruthenians will not allow pretenders to claim the legacy of our forefathers! [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('kyiv')] shall rise once again, and so too shall the Rus'!"
 ROM_f: "Roman Empire"
 ROM_f_desc: "Not since the second century has one empire commanded the entirety of the Mediterranean and beyond, and that empire was mighty Rome. If we claim this land, we can scoff at whatever pretenders may claim in Constantinople or the Holy Roman Empire, and proclaim ourselves as the #italic true#! successors of the Roman Empire. #italic Cives Romani sumus#!!"
 CTH_f: "Carthage"
 CTH_f_desc: "The foul dogs of the Roman Empire burned the Carthaginian homeland to the ground, trying to erase every single memory of this ancient civilization. Gone may be their identity, culture and religion, but as long as a single Roman pretender exists, so does the need for a foil to these charlatans. We shall become the scourge to all those fools who glorify the Romans; we shall become the Heirs of Carthage!"
 NSE_f: "North Sea Empire"
 NSE_f_desc: "The lands once owned by [GetCharacter('eng_cnut_the_great').GetName] extended over both sides of the [ShowAreaName('north_sea_area')], from [ShowRegionName('scandinavian_region')] to [ShowRegionName('great_britain_region')]. Although this territory has fragmented and reformed into different holdings over time, it has always been lying in wait, eagerly anticipating our rise and reclamation. It is time to establish this incredible empire once again, with all those lands coming together under our banner."
 MAY_f: "Maya"
 MAY_f_desc: "For centuries, our people have been divided into independent cities, which themselves have been locked in bitter competition with each other. This has created an environment of energy and innovation, but we lack the unity needed to stay strong in the face of external pressures. By unifying all Mayan settlements into a single realm, our nation will thrive, and reach the heights of power it soundly deserves to reach."
 AIA_f: "Arabia"
 AIA_f_desc: "The sands of [ShowRegionName('arabia_region')] are the home and origin of the [ShowCultureGroupName('arabian_group')] people. Although divided into multiple tribes since their beginnings, their shared identity and traditions are undeniable, crossing the vast sands along with its peoples. [ShowRegionNameWithNoTooltip('arabia_region')] was unified once before, and it conquered nearly the entire world. Now it must do so again."
 ULS_f: "Ulster"
 ULS_f_desc: "At the heart of the [ShowLanguageName('gaelic_language')] world and one of the traditional #italic Cúige#!, the Five Provinces of [ShowRegionName('ireland_region')], $ULS_f$ has a unique presence in the world. But our people yearn to do and be more than we already are, and as such, the time has come for $ULS_f$ to assert itself as a major player on the world stage."
 CEL_f: "Celtica"
 CEL_f_desc: "The [ShowCultureGroupName('celtic_group')] peoples have a history spanning millennia. Although over the centuries they have suffered invasions from other peoples and seen their territory reduced to a shadow of their ancestral holdings, they have never fully lost their traditional beliefs, culture, or way of life. If a strong leader were to emerge and show them the way, the [ShowCultureGroupNameWithNoTooltip('celtic_group')] could unite once more, and finally claim their rightful place of power in this world."
 MLC_f: "Malacca"
 MLC_f_desc: "Situated on a crucial maritime trade route, the straits of [ShowLocationName('malacca')] have always maintained control of the trade flowing through, and thus control of its wealth. Perfectly positioned to benefit from this trade, and holding a land itself rich in resources and tradition, the [ShowCultureName('malay_culture')] people have always flourished in these lands. With a unified identity, they will flourish even more."
 NED_f: "Netherlands"
 NED_f_desc: "The Dutch are emerging as one of Europe's most capable naval and colonial powers. Lucrative trade opportunities, locally and overseas, have resulted in a swift evolution that has transformed the country into one of the first capitalist nations in history. Complementing this superlative economic acumen are the Dutch talents for innovation and creativity, which turn our culture into a light shining all over the world. A unified Dutch state, therefore, stands to be one of the wealthiest and most influential of all time."
 EUR_f: "$EUR$"
 EUR_f_desc: "The land of [ShowContinentName('europe')] is home to a huge variety of people. With so many cultures, religions, languages, and lifestyles living side by side, [ShowContinentNameWithNoTooltip('europe')] has seen its share of neighborly conflicts as well as cultural synthesis and cooperation. The idea of such a diverse population working towards a single goal seems highly improbable. However, if all the different groups in [ShowContinentNameWithNoTooltip('europe')] united under a single banner and identity, we would achieve nearly unprecedented global power."
 RUS_f: "Russia"
 RUS_f_desc: "Through conquest and diplomacy, Russia has managed to transform itself from a tiny settlement into a dominant power. After several expeditions in the east, the Mongol hordes have finally been subdued, and a centralized Russian state under the suzerainty of the Tsar is emerging. Influences from Western Europe are helping us modernize and reform our nation, and we are adopting a more modern style of education. Given our history of rapid growth and our modern political and cultural gifts, it seems only natural that the Russian Empire should rise and hold sway over lesser nations."
 ITA_f: "Italy"
 ITA_f_desc: "As the heart of the Renaissance, our nation's culture is blossoming. We seem to have just entered a period of prolonged artistic innovation, especially in the fields of architecture and literature, and are reaping the rewards accordingly. This cultural evolution does not help us maintain peace within our borders, however, and our country is continuously stricken by foreign states seeking power and territorial gain. Perhaps it is time to unite in a decisive demonstration of our power — if for no other reason than to intimidate would-be usurpers by displaying a united front."
 TWS_f: "The Two Sicilies"
 TWS_f_desc: "The Two Sicilies...not a country, but a dream. A dream to unify the lands kissed by the waters of the Straits of Messina — the Sicilies that stand on both sides of the 'Punta del Faro.' It is our duty to make that dream come true."
 FRA_f: "$FRA$"
 FRA_f_desc: "This year will mark the beginning of an evolutionary period for our nation. The old feudal ways must make way for a more modern, centralized state."
 LOT_f: "$LOT$"
 LOT_f_desc: "As the new claimants to the $LOT_ADJ$ crown, we confirmed our legitimacy by appealing to the legacy of [GetCharacter('fra_charlemagne').GetName] and [GetCharacter('fra_lothair').GetName]. Under our patronage, the exploits of our ancestors have once again become common knowledge, both among our own people and throughout the courts of Europe."
 BGP_f: "$BGP$"
 BGP_f_desc: "Back in the day, the Burgunds came down from Bornholm, settled in these lands, and gave them their name. As their descendants, our honor requires us to recreate that nation and govern these lands until the end of time."
 GRE_f: "Greece"
 GRE_f_desc: "Since the earliest days of our civilization, Hellas has been divided, whether internally by its many competing kingdoms, or occupied by foreigners at the hands of our common enemies. Over the centuries, our power dwindled as we were conquered, split up, and our treasures taken by conquerors. It is an insult to our extensive legacy of art, sport, and invention to exist in such a fragmented state! To unite the Greek lands under one flag and one ruler is our only path back to the greatness of our past."
 BYZ_f: "Byzantine Empire"
 BYZ_f_desc: "The glorious Byzantine Empire is long gone, but as long as Greeks live in [ShowLocationName('constantinople')], there is hope of its resurrection. Like a phoenix swirling back to life from a pile of ashes, so too must the remnants of Eastern Rome. But before we can reunite into a vital empire, we must quell internal dissent and ensure we are all working towards the same goal. After all, we can take the place of the Byzantine Empire in spirit, but we cannot take its name until we prove worthy of it..."
 CNN_f: "Connacht"
 CNN_f_desc: "One of the traditional kingdoms of [ShowRegionName('ireland_region')], $CNN_f$ boasts a long and storied history. Having gained enough influence to obtain High Kingship over the whole island, $CNN_f$ has a certain claim to tradition and leadership — but whether we will be able to stand firm in the face of would-be oppressors or not depends on our unification."
 HEN_f: "Hen Ogledd"
 HEN_f_desc: "The [ShowLanguageName('brythonic_language')] peoples could once be found all over the region of [ShowRegionName('great_britain_region')]. Although they were first forced away from the southern lands by both the Romans and the Anglo-Saxons, they managed to maintain a strong presence in the northern parts of the island until the arrival of the [ShowLanguageName('gaelic_language')] peoples. Over time, we started losing our mother tongue and culture... but no more! It is time to reclaim the old kingdom of the north, and see the [ShowLanguageNameWithNoTooltip('brythonic_language')] people unified by law as well as by language."
 USA_f: "United States"
 USA_f_desc: "We the people are exhausted: by foreign rulers who see us as property, by oppressive and abusive taxation policies when we ourselves have no say in our government, and by the cruelty of our Loyalist neighbors. Long have these colonies been subject to the greed of European powers, but no more! The surge of liberty in the colonies has granted us an opportunity to form a proud federation of independent states free from tyranny. Give us liberty, or give us death!"
 CAN_f: "Canada"
 CAN_f_desc: "The land of [ShowRegionName('canada_region')] is vast and foreboding, yet incredibly bountiful and rich in resources. Although the terrain can be extremely harsh, there is great promise — and fortune — in these lands.

 MEX_f: "Mexico"
 MEX_f_desc: "The lands of [ShowRegionName('mesoamerica_region')] are rich and plentiful, with a diverse population and a long history of civilization. Yet we are fractured between different groups, and weakened by internal bickering over power and resources between those groups. It is time we establish a new identity for all of us, one that shows off our strength, power, and enviable history while also presenting a unified and impenetrable front to the rest of the world."
 DEC_f: "Deccan"
 DEC_f_desc: "This land was once foreign to our ancestors, but we have made it our own. Here we have built a new society where Persian influences have met local ancient Indian traditions. We have our own language, our own administrative traditions and our own myths and legends. It is time we show the world that the South has overcome its differences and is united as one."
 MHR_f: "Maratha"
 MHR_f_desc: "The [ShowCultureName('marathi_culture')] peoples have been fragmented for many years, but remain proud of our literary achievements and unique language. While unification may not be foremost in our peoples' minds, [ShowCultureName('marathi_culture')] warriors all over Deccan will gather to our banners if we show clear leadership and acquire all the great forts of the Desh. Let us unite the clans, and go forth to rule India once and for all!"
 HIN_f: "$HIN$"
 HIN_f_desc: "People from $india$, although highly diverse in culture, traditions, and beliefs, all belong to this same land, and share its history.

 PUN_f: "$PUN$"
 PUN_f_desc: "The [ShowCultureName('punjabi')] people are only too familiar with foreign invasions, having endured wave after wave of conquest over the centuries. But these incursions have led to enormous advances in our economic and religious practices, as well as a flourishing of literary arts.

 RJP_f: "$RJP$"
 RJP_f_desc: "The lands of [ShowAreaName('rajputana_area')] have been shattered and weak ever since the Muslim invasion. But that was centuries ago, and our people have begun to raise their heads from the yoke of our oppressors, seeking a place closer to the stars where we belong.

 GUJ_f: "$GUJ$"
 GUJ_f_desc: "[ShowAreaName('gujarat_area')] has always had an identity distinct from the rest of $india$, and [ShowLanguageName('gujarati_language')] people are proud of their ancient history and unique identity.

 SHA_f: "Shan"
 SHA_f_desc: "The [ShowLanguageFamilyName(tai_language_family)] peoples of the [ShowAreaName('shan_highland_area')] have long been masters of our domain. We have carved the surrounding hills into terraced farms; we have built temples that will stand forever in testament to our gods.

But no more — although we were once divided, we Shan now stand as one against them all!"

 SIA_f: "Siam"
 SIA_f_desc: "The [ShowCultureName('thai_culture')] people live divided by mountains and river valleys, between overlapping spheres of influence, and thus have always gravitated towards local centers of power rather than a central authority. But a unified [ShowCultureNameWithNoTooltip('thai_culture')] homeland would be more beneficial than our current dispersed nature — that consolidation of our power would make it much easier to lead our people to greatness."
 BAN_f: "Banten"
 BAN_f_desc: "The [ShowCultureName('sundanese_culture')] from [ShowLocationName('banten')] can boast of great prosperity, due to their unfettered access to both overland and maritime trade routes.

 IRA_f_desc: "[ShowRegionName('persia_region')] has been the seat of powerful empires since the ancient days of Cyrus the Great.

 SKO_f: "Sokoto"
 SKO_f_desc: "The presence of [ShowReligionGroupName('muslim')] in the region of Western [ShowContinentName('africa')] is ever-precarious. With so many different peoples represented in our population, we run the risk of religious conflict erupting at any moment, both inside and coming from outside our borders.

 KON_f_desc: "The [ShowLanguageName('kongo_language')] people are a branch of the [ShowLanguageFamilyName('bantu_language_family')]. Although great diversity exists among our people, we also have many commonalities in our daily spiritual and cultural practices. If we connect along these shared characteristics and agree to be a united nation rather than an assortment of individual settlements, the [ShowLanguageNameWithNoTooltip('kongo_language')]-speaking peoples will be able to achieve more than ever before."
 NTR_f: "United Tribes"
 NTR_f_desc: "The [ShowCultureName('maori_culture')] people of [ShowRegionName('new_zealand_region')] have always divided themselves into separate tribes, deeply connected through kinship and marriage. On one hand, our separation and individualism has created a cultural resilience that gives our traditional ways room to thrive. On the other hand, we could more easily repel attempted invaders were we to unite under a single banner and present our people as a holistic power. Perhaps this is the way of our future?"
 TIM_f: "The Timurids"
 TIM_f_desc: "The many battles fought by our ancestors may have soaked the earth in blood, but that bloodshed in turn fed the soil, and from this adversity was born a race of warriors, architects, artists, and scientists.

As such, we have blended aspects from many cultures and places to create our own distinct way of life.
