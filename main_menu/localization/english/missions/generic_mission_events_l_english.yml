 generic_mission_events.16.desc: "Amid the tide of centralization, [target_character.GetName] has put forth sweeping reforms to overhaul the taxation system of our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetFlavorRank].

Yet such ambitions do not go unnoticed. Indeed, every estate, from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetEstateName('burghers_estate')], stands to lose influence, and their unease is already turning to resistance."
