 lesson_core_loop_0: "@caesar! Gameplay Introduction"
 lesson_core_loop_0_desc: "#high Europa Universalis V#! is a vast game that allows for countless different playstyles and possibilities.\n\nRegardless of whether you fancy yourself a ruthless conqueror, a shrewd politician, or an administrator endowed with the touch of Midas, there are some fundamentals that every successful ruler needs to master. Let us take a look at them!" 

 lesson_core_loop_1: "[gold_icon] Balance"
 lesson_core_loop_1_desc: "As we mentioned, [gold_with_icon|e] are one of the most important resources in the game. Most actions cost [gold], and very often your ability to impose your will as a ruler, both outside and inside your [country_with_icon|e], will depend on the wealth you are able to concentrate into your hands. The path to global domination is paved with gold and blood.\n\nMost of your finances are controlled from the [Link('economy', '', '@economy_panel! Balance Panel')], so let us take a close look at it." 
 lesson_core_loop_open_balance: "Open the Balance Panel"

 lesson_core_loop_2: "[gold_icon] Balance"
 lesson_core_loop_2_desc: "Here you can find an overview of your [budget_with_icon|e]. The difference between your [income_with_icon|e] and your [expenses_with_icon|e] will be added to your [treasury_with_icon|e] at the end of every month. You can manipulate the different sliders in this panel to modify your monthly [balance].\n\nAs we just saw, the difference between your monthly income and expenses is also displayed at the #high Topbar#!." 

 lesson_core_loop_3: "[taxes_icon] Taxes"
 lesson_core_loop_3_desc: "Most of the wealth in #high Europa Universalis V#! is generated on a monthly basis in the land you own: your [locations_with_icon|e].\n\nWe will talk about Locations later. For now, you can hover over the [tax_base_with_icon|e] number in the top-left corner to see a disclosure of your richest Locations. That is where the [gold_with_icon|e] are being generated in the [country_icon] [Player.GetLongName]." 

 lesson_core_loop_4: "[taxes_icon] Taxes"
 lesson_core_loop_4_desc: "However, those [gold_with_icon|e] do not go directly into your [treasury_with_icon|e]. As the Government, you only collect a fraction of the [tax_base_with_icon|e] by exacting [taxes_with_icon|e] from your [estates_with_icon|e].\n\nYou can set the level of taxation by adjusting the tax sliders in the budget panel. Notice how their [estate_satisfaction_with_icon|e] drops the more you tax them. Estates do not like Taxes.\n\nThe [maximum_tax_with_icon|e] that you can set for each Estate depends on many factors, like how powerful they are. Sometimes, you might not be able to Tax a specific Estate at all.\n\nFor now, we recommend you automate your taxes by clicking on the @automation! #W Cog#! icon. That will tax them the just amount to keep their satisfaction over #G 50%#! [estate_satisfaction_icon] as soon as you unpause the game." 
 lesson_core_loop_automate_taxes: "Automate Taxes to all Estates"

 lesson_core_loop_5: "[income_icon] Monthly Income"
 lesson_core_loop_5_desc: "Aside from [taxes_with_icon|e], another significant source of [income_with_icon|e] is [minting_with_icon|e]. You can freely mint to your heart's content to fix your budget, but minting too much will create [inflation_with_icon|e].\n\nYou can learn more about [inflation] in the [Link('hints', 'selected_hint = hint_inflation', '@hint! Inflation Hint')]." 
 lesson_core_loop_minting: "Move the Minting sliders to Mint some shiny Ducats"
 lesson_core_loop_inflation: "Make sure you are not creating Inflation"

 lesson_core_loop_6: "[income_icon] Monthly Income"
 lesson_core_loop_6_desc: "The other two most common sources of [income_with_icon|e] are [trade_with_icon|e] and [food_with_icon|e]. Since those are more advanced concepts, we will not cover them for now. You can learn about them whenever you feel prepared in their respective Hints:\n\n$TAB$[Link('hints', 'selected_hint = hint_trade', '@hint! Trade Hint')]\n$TAB$[Link('hints', 'selected_hint = hint_food', '@hint! Food Hint')]"


 lesson_core_loop_7: "@caesar! Unpausing"
 lesson_core_loop_7_desc: "Let us unpause for a bit before looking at the [expenses_with_icon|e].\n\nYou can adjust the #high Speed#! at which the game runs from the #high Topbar#!. Speeds #high 3#! or #high 4#! are a good pace to start, but every player has their own preference.\n\nYou can also press @key_space! to #high Pause#! and #high Unpause#! the game at any moment."
 lesson_core_loop_unpause_month: "Unpause and let a month go by to see the numbers update"

 lesson_core_loop_7b: "@caesar! Unpausing"
 lesson_core_loop_7b_desc: "Good! One month has passed, and we have #high Paused#! the game for you.\n\nYou can see now that the numbers have updated and your [estates_with_icon|e] are contributing their due [taxes_with_icon|e]. Many calculations in this game happen at the end of a month.\n\nLet us take a look at the [expenses_with_icon|e] now."

 lesson_core_loop_8: "[expenses_icon] Monthly Expenses"
 lesson_core_loop_8_desc: "Many actions in the game cost [gold_with_icon|e] the very moment you perform them. But even when you are not actively spending your [gold], your [budget_with_icon|e] has to bear the burden of regular monthly [expenses_with_icon|e].\n\nYou can spend [gold] on increasing [stability_with_icon|e] and [legitimacy_with_icon|e], two of your most important stats that we saw at the #high Topbar#!. We recommend you spend at least enough so they do not decrease.\n\nThe [maintenance_with_icon|e] cost of your standing [armies_with_icon|e], [navies_with_icon|e], and active [fortifications_with_icon|e] can become a significant hindrance to your [budget]. Reducing their [maintenance] during peacetime is a sensible idea." 
 lesson_core_loop_positive_income: "Adjust the budget sliders to end up with a positive monthly balance"
 

 lesson_core_loop_9: "[budget_icon] Budget Recap"
 lesson_core_loop_9_desc: "Perfect! You have understood the basics of [budget_with_icon|e] management. Let us recap a bit:\n\n$BULLET$[income_with_icon|e] and [expenses_with_icon|e] are calculated at the end of the month.\n\n$BULLET$[gold_with_icon|e] are generated in your [locations_with_icon|e] and collected by your [estates], which you [tax_with_icon|e] in order to fuel your [treasury_with_icon|e].\n\n$BULLET$[estates_with_icon|e] do not particularly enjoy being taxed.\n\n\nBut who are these [estates], I hear you ask, and why do they not submit to your every whim?" 

 lesson_estates_1: "[estates_icon] The Crown and the Estates"
 lesson_estates_1_desc: "The [estates_with_icon|e] are one of the keystones of ruling in #high Europa Universalis V#!. Not only are they the source of [taxes_with_icon|e], but they can also be powerful assets when they are loyal, or terrible enemies when disloyal.\n\nLet us take a closer look at them in the @government_panel![Link('government', 'tabcontent = estates', 'lateralview_government_entry_name')]."

 lesson_estates_2: "[crown_power_icon] The Crown"
 lesson_estates_2_desc: "Here you can see the different groups that control the [political_power] in your [country_with_icon|e]: the [estates_with_icon|e]. Each [estate] has a percentage of [estate_power_with_icon|e]. As the embodiment of the nation, you are represented by the [GetEstateName('crown_estate')].\n\nYour [crown_power_with_icon|e] represents your ability to oppose the particular interests of your Estates. Namely, it allows you to exact higher [taxes_with_icon|e], it increases [estate_satisfaction_with_icon|e] and your support in the [parliament_with_icon|e], it makes changing [laws_with_icon|e] easier, and it provides a percentage of the profits of [trade_with_icon|e].\n\n@hint! You can learn more about Crown Power in the [Link('hints', 'selected_hint = hint_crown_power', 'Crown Power Hint')]."

 lesson_estates_3: "[estates_icon] The Estates"
 lesson_estates_3_desc: "Your [estates_with_icon|e] can be powerful assets when managed correctly, but, if displeased, can quickly turn into an insidious thorn in your back.\n\nOn top of contributing to your treasury with [taxes_with_icon|e], [estates] are essential to the business of [war_with_icon|e], since you will depend on their [levies_with_icon|e] to fight your wars, until you can afford to replace them with [regular_regiments_with_icon|e].\n\nHowever, if they are disloyal, they might start supporting [rebellions_with_icon|e] against your power, potentially overthrowing your rule through a [civil_war_with_icon|e].\n\nFinally, Estates whose satisfaction is above #G 50%#! [estate_satisfaction_icon] will provide different bonuses to your [country_with_icon|e] depending on their type, while dissatisfied Estates will inflict penalties."

 lesson_estates_4: "[privileges_icon] Privileges"
 lesson_estates_4_desc: "[estates] can be granted [privileges_with_icon|e], which usually increase both their [estate_satisfaction_with_icon|e] and [estate_power_with_icon|e], and come with additional effects for your country and your people.\n\nRevoking Privileges will both anger and weaken the target Estate, although that can be a costly endeavor that will likely ruin your [stability_with_icon|e].\n\nDespite them increasing the power of the Estates (and thus reducing your [crown_power_with_icon|e]), some Privileges might align with your interests. Granting a few privileges in times of need can be a wise course of action indeed, if only to extinguish a spark of [rebellion_with_icon|e]. No king can rule alone."

 lesson_estates_5: "[pop_type_icon|e] Social Classes"
 lesson_estates_5_desc: "Aside from [privileges], [estates_with_icon|e] derive their [estate_power_with_icon|e] primarily from the social make-up of your [population_with_icon|e].\n\nYour [population] is divided into different [pop_types_with_icon|e], each of which supports a different [estate]:\n\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$The [GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] are supported by @nobles! [ShowPopTypeName('nobles')]\n$BULLET_WITH_TAB$The [GetEstateName('clergy_estate')] are supported by @clergy!

[ShowPopTypeName('laborers')], and @soldiers! [ShowPopTypeName('soldiers')].\n\nYour [population] lives and dies in your [locations_with_icon|e], that is, on the map. So let us take a look at them."

 lesson_map_1: "[known_world_icon] The Map"
 lesson_map_1_desc: "The world of #high Europa Universalis V#! is made of different [countries_with_icon|e] that own [locations_with_icon|e] on the map, from where they extract the resources and manpower they need to stay ahead of their neighbors.\n\nIf you zoom out, you will see [country] names appear on the map.

As we just saw, [pops_with_icon|e] will increase the [estate_power_with_icon|e] of their respective [estate_with_icon|e].\n\nThe amount of [pops] of each [pop_type] depends mainly on the [buildings_with_icon|e] present in the [location].
