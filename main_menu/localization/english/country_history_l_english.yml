 country_history_ARA: "The [GetCountry('ARA').GetLongName] stands proudly as a significant power in the western Mediterranean region, thanks to its maritime prowess, diplomatic weight, and flourishing trade networks.\n\nThe stabilization of the Kingdom of [ShowLocationName('valencia')] and the ongoing conquest of the newly-created Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica might ensure its dominance of the seas. However, despite its relative stability, challenges loom on the horizon. To the East, the [GetCountry('MLL').GetLongName] faces economic difficulties, and its ruler's animosity towards [GetCountry('ARA').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] might lead to conflict. In the peninsula, the threat of the [GetCountry('CAS').GetLongName] is becoming more and more real as the #italic Reconquista#! comes to an end. To the north, the [GetCountry('FRA').GetLongName] have consolidated their dominion over the [ShowAreaName('languedoc_area')] in the last century.\n\nHow should the young [GetCountry('ARA').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetShortName] face the challenges to come? Will [GetCountry('ARA').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHeShe] focus on the Mediterranean Sea and rule the waves from [ShowLocationName('barcelona')] to the Holy Land? Will [GetCountry('ARA').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHeShe] turn around and claim dominance over Iberia? Or will [GetCountry('ARA').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetHeShe] try to get revenge for the Battle of Muret in 1213, and recover long-lost ancient holdings north of the Pyrenees?"

 country_history_AZT: "For the past two centuries, groups of [ShowCultureName('nahua_culture')] people descended from the Chichimec migrated to central Mexico from their legendary ancestral home, known as Aztlan. Our people were one of those wandering groups.\n\nAs with many other [ShowCultureNameWithNoTooltip('nahua_culture')] nations, we established our own [ShowGovernmentReformName('altepetl')] called [ShowLocationName('tenochtitlan')], which was built on an artificial island in the heart of [ShowLocationName('texcoco_lake')].\n\nOur most prominent figures were also influenced by the [ShowCultureName('toltec_culture')] culture, and as a result, we developed a refined and sophisticated civilization, cradled in the lagoon. We would also be recognized as skilled fighters by our neighbors, as our equally refined battle skills made the armies of [GetCountry('AZT').GetLongName] a force to be feared...\n\nHowever, we currently stand as vassals of the [ShowGovernmentReformNameWithNoTooltip('altepetl')] of [GetCountry('TEP').GetName], and as such, our expansion possibilities are limited to the areas around the lagoon they inhabit. Only a brilliant and capable ruler could possibly lead the [GetCountry('AZT').GetNameWithNoTooltip] in our journey to subdue the Valley of Mexico and conquer lands beyond — could it be [GetCountry('AZT').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetShortName]?"

 country_history_BOH: "The lands of [GetCountry('BOH').GetName] are in the heart of the Germanic [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetName], and inhabited by [ShowCultureName('slavic')] people. After a long period under the [ShowDynastyName('premyslid_dynasty')] dynasty, the current [ShowDynastyName('luxembourg_dynasty')] rulers may drastically change matters by tightening the country's existing ties with the Empire, although [GetCountry('BOH').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetName] is more [ShowCultureName('french')] than [ShowCultureGroupName('german_group')], having been educated in the royal court of [ShowLocationName('paris')]. Keeping both the [GetCountry('BOH').GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] and the [GetCountry('BOH').GetGovernment.GetEstateName('peasants_estate')] satisfied under a foreign [GetCountry('BOH').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], while navigating the political intricacies of the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('hre').GetNameWithNoTooltip], would prove a hurdle for anybody. Fortunately, [GetCountry('BOH').GetNameWithNoTooltip] is a strong [GetCountry('BOH').GetFlavorRank], but will it succeed in its ambitions?"

 country_history_BYZ: "Once a proud [GetCountry('BYZ').GetFlavorRank] that stretched from [ShowRegionName('egypt_region')] and the [ShowAreaName('levant_area')] to [ShowRegionName('iberia_region')] and [ShowRegionName('italy_region')], [GetCountry('BYZ').GetName] now faces a period of almost inexorable decline caused by the shock of the Fourth Crusade, even after the recovery of [ShowLocationName('constantinople')] by the [GetCountry('BYZ').GetGovernment.GetRuler.GetDynasty.GetName]. During [GetCharacter('byz_andronikos_ii_palaiologos').GetHerHis] reign, [GetCharacter('byz_andronikos_ii_palaiologos').GetName] saw fit to dissolve several key institutions, such as the Navy, in an attempt to save the dying economy of the country, while the [ShowGovernmentReformName('theme_system')] continued to be a shadow of what it was, as the [GetCountry('BYZ').GetFlavorRank] lost territory across all fronts.\n\n[GetCharacter('byz_andronikos_ii_palaiologos').GetHerHis|U] successor, [GetCharacter('byz_andronikos_iii_palaiologos').GetName], is now faced with the difficult task of safeguarding what remains of our once-glorious [GetCountry('BYZ').GetFlavorRank]. To our east, [GetCountry('TUR').GetName] have started amassing a large army to wipe out our remaining holdings in [ShowRegionName('anatolia_region')], threatening to set foot across the straits. At the same time, [GetCharacter('ser_stefan_dusan').GetName] eyes [ShowLocationName('thessaloniki')] and [ShowProvinceDefinitionName('north_epirus_province')] like a vulture. Meanwhile, our treasury runs dry of precious coin, and the country may yet be thrown into a perilous civil war, as the family of our [GetCountry('BYZ').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] conspires with the [GetCountry('BYZ').GetGovernment.GetEstateName('nobles_estate')] behind closed doors. Can the [GetCountry('BYZ').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] lift this once-great nation from the ashes?"

 country_history_CAS: "The [GetCountry('CAS').GetLongName] was formed through the union of its two constituent parts, the Kingdom of [GetCountry('CAS').GetNameWithNoTooltip] and the [GetCountry('LON').GetLongName], when they were reunited after both titles were inherited by [GetCharacter('cas_fernando_iii_burgundy').GetName] in 1230. A century later, [GetCharacter('cas_alfonso_xi_burgundy').GetName] rules without much opposition, having overcome a troubled start to his reign following the end of a long regency under his grandmother, [GetCharacter('cas_maria_molina').GetName].\n\nAfter reining in the nobility of the realm, led by his relative [GetCharacter('cas_juan_manuel').GetName], and having stabilized the governance of the country, [GetCharacter('cas_alfonso_xi_burgundy').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] is now turning his attention to the southern border. The [GetCountry('GRA').GetLongName] has menaced our country since the emirate became independent a century ago, backed by the powerful [GetCountry('MOR').GetLongName], which has a foothold on Iberia through a petty kingdom centered on [ShowLocationName('algeciras')] and [ShowLocationName('ronda')], and held by [GetCharacter('mor_abu_malik_abd_al_wahid').GetName], son and heir of [GetCharacter('mor_abu_al_hasan_ali').GetName].\n\nHowever, these are not the only troubles for [GetCharacter('cas_alfonso_xi_burgundy').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip], as his relationship with his beloved mistress, [GetCharacter('cas_leonor_guzman').GetName], and [GetCharacter('cas_alfonso_xi_burgundy').GetHerHis] children by [GetCharacter('cas_leonor_guzman').GetHerHis] have eroded the relationship with the king's actual wife, [GetCharacter('cas_maria_portugal').GetName], daughter of [GetCharacter('por_afonso_iv_portugal').GetName]. With the latter living apart from the [GetCountry('CAS').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle], this rift in the royal family now leaves the looming question of just who will succeed him when he passes.\n\nWill [GetCharacter('cas_alfonso_xi_burgundy').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] and his successors be able to deal with these threats to the [GetCountry('CAS').GetLongNameWithNoTooltip], both at home and abroad?"

 country_history_CHA: "[GetCountry('CHA').GetName] is a collection of many different, somewhat autonomous Cham polities which have united to form a single [GetCountry('CHA').GetFlavorRank]. As the only [ShowReligionAdjective('hindu')] state in mainland [ShowRegionName('indochina_region')], the people of the [GetCountry('CHA').GetLongNameWithNoTooltip] face constant threat from the decaying [GetCountry('KHM').GetLongName] to their west and the aggressive [GetCountry('DAI').GetLongName] to their north. Despite these external threats, the seafaring acumen of the [GetCountry('CHA').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] people has allowed them to amass wealth and power over the seas of [ShowRegionName('indonesia_region')].\n\nOnce a conglomerate of disparate groups, [GetCountry('CHA').GetName] has blossomed into a sophisticated force to be reckoned with, but will it take its rightful place as the ruler of all nations?"
 
 country_history_CHI: "Established by [GetCharacter('kublai_khan').GetName], the [GetCountry('CHI').GetLongName] now controls the vast expanse of a great $rank_empire$. Having tamed $china$, and thriving under [GetCharacter('kublai_khan').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]'s legendary leadership, they have reached stratospheric heights of prestige and splendor.\n\nHowever, their influence over the subcontinent is waning. Internal strife, instability, and cultural friction have corroded what once was prosperous and magnificent, and those who wish to dethrone the [GetCountry('CHI').GetNameWithNoTooltip] and usurp their mandate are gathering their strength. Plotting and scheming within [GetCountry('CHI').GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s borders, these traitors seek to find every possible weakness within the $rank_empire$'s rule, vying for scraps of power and a passing mention in the scrolls of history. But while many may struggle and die for the honor, only one leader can sit on the Dragon Throne and fulfill the will of Heaven."

 country_history_CHK: "The $town$ of [ShowLocationName('cahokia')], a settlement built on a confluence of sacred rivers and blessed with fertile lands, has grown and evolved into a complex society. Life in [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('cahokia')] revolves around the cultivation of the surrounding fertile valley, where the Three Sisters — maize, beans, and squash — grow tall, and around bowing to the rule of the [GetCountry('CHK').GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')], who are prolific builders of temples. The culture of [ShowCultureName('cahokia_culture')] has spread throughout the surrounding area, creating a vast sphere of influence and drawing new residents from around the region.\n\nGiven our strictly organized society and highly influential culture, we have risen to a position most other peoples can only dream of. However, we may yet face insurmountable, unforeseeable threats. Will we be able to further build and develop our society, or will our glories be lost, and forgotten forever?"

 country_history_CSU: "Guided by the sun god, Inti, the first of our leaders founded [ShowLocationName('qusqu')] on the precise spot where his golden staff sank into the earth. After centuries of living alongside other groups, the [ShowCultureName('inca_culture')] finally achieved dominance, and we established ourselves as the scions of this beautiful place. The high volcanoes and rushing rivers of the Andes Mountains shelter and nourish the Sacred Valley of the Incas, where we, the sons of the Sun, dwell in our magnificent city and make ready for the glorious future awaiting us. From our towering bulwark of mountains to our bountiful terraced farmlands, other nations can only gaze in envy at our riches.\n\nAfter years of power consolidation and politics, the time has come for our people to expand their influence outside our precious valley; to defeat our enemies and follow the paths of the mountains until we stand in each corner of this world. Are we prepared to face this destiny? Or will our enemies defeat us before we can reach our prime?"

 country_history_DAI: "Rising from the aftermath of a civil war with the Ngô dynasty in 968, the [GetCountry('DAI').GetLongName] has struggled ever since against the $chinese_group$ Empire's rapidly expanding sphere of influence to the north. Although part of the [GetUniqueInternationalOrganization('middle_kingdom').GetName], the [GetCountry('DAI').GetCulture.GetName] people have had to defend their lands from [GetCountry('CHI').GetCulture.GetName] invaders on multiple occasions, breeding powerful, long-lasting resentments.\n\nAide from external threats, the [GetCountry('DAI').GetFlavorRank] also faces the problems caused by a highly decentralized state, with the additional challenges brought by both [ShowEstatePrivilegeName('peasants_autonomous_villages')], and a volatile court life where hostile actors constantly seek to seize the [GetCountry('DAI').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] throne.\n\nDespite all these obstacles, [GetCountry('DAI').GetNameWithNoTooltip] finds itself in an opportunistic situation, as the [GetCountry('CHA').GetLongName] is surrounded by enemies and ripe for the taking, and [GetCountry('KHM').GetName] faces internal decay at every front. This must be a sign that the ascension of the [GetCountry('DAI').GetFlavorRank] to become the mightiest empire in [ShowRegionName('indochina_region')] is finally at hand!"

 country_history_DAN: "Long a powerful player on the world stage, the [GetCountry('DAN').GetLongName] now finds itself in quite a precarious situation. During the previous rule of [GetCharacter('dan_chistopher_ii').GetName], large portions of the country were mortgaged to prominent members of the [ShowCultureName('danish')] and [ShowCultureGroupName('german_group')] [ShowEstateTypeName('nobles_estate')], the [GetCountry('SLV').GetLongName] was forcibly separated from the crown lands, and even the territory of [GetCountry('SKE').GetName] had to be sold to the [GetCountry('SWE').GetLongName]. This shameful state of affairs worsened when [GetCharacter('dan_chistopher_ii').GetNameWithNoTooltip] was dethroned by [GetCharacter('shl_gerhard_iii_holstein_rendsburg').GetName] after installing his own nephew [GetCharacter('dan_valdemar_iii').GetName] on the throne, only to ultimately be brought back again as a puppet king. Since [GetCharacter('dan_chistopher_ii').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip]'s death, [GetCharacter('shl_gerhard_iii_holstein_rendsburg').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] has been the de facto ruler of [GetCountry('DAN').GetNameWithNoTooltip].\n\nIt will not be easy to overcome this situation, but [GetCountry('DAN').GetAdjective] are resilient and resolute, and [GetCharacter('dan_valdemar_atterdag').GetName], son of [GetCharacter('dan_chistopher_ii').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] is already crafting a plan to recover the authority of the [GetCountry('DAN').GetFlavorRank]. Whether it will be successful or not remains to be seen."

 country_history_DHM: "The [GetCountry('DHM').GetLongName] is no ordinary lordship, but a [GetCountry('DHM').GetFlavorRank] under the [GetCountry('ENG').GetLongName], where the [GetCountry('DHM').GetGovernment.GetRulerTitle] rules with near-regal authority. Entrusted with powers to raise armies, mint coinage, and administer justice, the Bishop of [ShowLocationName('durham')] acts as a temporal prince over his domain in [ShowAreaName('northumbria_area')].\n\nFor generations, this exceptional autonomy has allowed the bishops to guard the northern frontier from [GetCountry('SCO').GetAdjective] raids, their fortified seat at [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('durham')] a bastion of loyalty amidst the marches.\n\nYet the times are uncertain. The border grows restless, [GetCountry('SCO').GetName] remains hostile, and even amongst the [GetCountry('DHM').GetGovernment.GetEstateName('clergy_estate')], murmurs of reform and ambition stir. Though cloaked in sacred robes, the [GetCountry('DHM').GetFlavorRank] of [ShowLocationNameWithNoTooltip('durham')] stands as a political creature — and one who may yet rise to play a greater role in the affairs of the realm.\n\nWill the [GetCountry('DHM').GetFlavorRank] remain a quiet corner of royal service, or could it become a power in its own right, a great northern kingdom in all but name?"

 country_history_DLH: "A series of swift and decisive conquests in the last century gave birth to our great [GetCountry('DLH').GetLongName]. With territories under our jurisdiction spanning from from [ShowRegionName('deccan_region')] to the fertile fields of [ShowLocationName('lahore')], no other civilization can match our prestigious accomplishments.\n\nHowever, it has become apparent that we have overextended our authority across such a vast [GetCountry('DLH').GetFlavorRank]; it is becoming increasingly difficult to control nowadays. Our enemies are many, and they seek to nullify our superior heritage and sophisticated culture. To the east, our subjects in [ShowAreaName('bengal_area')] have started questioning their masters, while our southern territories have long disputed our hold over them. And the [ShowReligionAdjective('hindu')] countries of Southern $india$ may further entrench their resistance to our rule, led by the rising power of [GetCountry('VIJ').GetName].\n\nWhile this situation feels precarious, we trust the guidance of [GetCharacter('dlh_muhammad_bin_tughluq').GetName], whose watchful eye may safeguard our lands against threats, and thus prevent our downfall..."

 country_history_DMS: "The [GetCountry('DMS').GetLongName] lies in the rugged southwestern reaches of Ireland. Though far from [ShowLocationName('dublin')], it is no remote backwater — it is ruled by [GetCharacter('dms_maurice_fitzgerald').GetName], 1st Earl of Desmond, head of the southern branch of the mighty [ShowDynastyName('fitzgerald_dynasty')], and one of the most powerful lords in all of [ShowRegionName('ireland_region')].\n\nGranted his earldom in 1329, he carved out a semi-independent domain from the Gaelic chiefs of [GetCountry('THO').GetName] and the English crown authority of [GetCountry('PLE').GetName].\n\nThe Earldom is marked by shifting alliances, rival marcher barons, and persistent tension with both Dublin and London. As English royal power wanes in the west, we may seize the opportunity to assert autonomy, play the Gaelic clans against each other, or even claim kingship in all but name.\n\nWill Desmond become a linchpin of a new Hiberno-Norman resurgence? Or will it be swallowed by the tide of Gaelic reconquest and the feuds of rival dynasties?"

 country_history_ENG: "The [GetCountry('ENG').GetAdjective] crown is still reeling from the treacherous rebellion that occurred ten year prior and resulted in the underhanded assassination of [GetCharacter('eng_edward_ii').GetShortName]. Although the ringleaders were executed, several co-conspirators have been granted mercy in the name of peace — a peace which could easily be shattered at any moment.\n\nMeanwhile, [GetCharacter('eng_edward_ii').GetShortName]'s surviving heir, [GetCharacter('eng_edward_iii').GetShortName], has already proven to be a capable young ruler, and is making bold designs on the [GetCountry('FRA').GetAdjective] throne — a throne which is his birthright as the grandson of a [ShowDynastyName('capet_dynasty')] ruler.\n\nIn the north, the misguided [GetCountry('SBL').GetName] weakly contends for the [GetCountry('SCO').GetAdjective] crown, while our loyal vassals maintain a tight grip on the governments of [GetCountry('WLS').GetName], [GetCountry('PLE').GetName], and [GetCountry('AQN').GetName].\n\nHow shall we brave the turbulent years to come? Will we cross the channel and become a continental power, or should we look to the seas for global dominion?"

 country_history_ERE: "Founded by [GetCharacter('ere_eretna').GetName], an Ilkhanid officer of [ShowCultureName('uyghur_culture')] origin, this Beylik state emerged after his victory at the Battle of Karanbük against [ShowCultureName('mongolian_culture')] warlords. Declaring independence from his former overlords, [GetCharacter('ere_eretna').GetNameWithNoTooltip] became the sultan and earned the nickname #italic Köse Peyghamber#!, 'the Beardless Prophet', for his prosperous reign. $anatolia_desc$"

 country_history_ETH: "The [GetCountry('ETH').GetLongName] is an ancient land rich with history and traditions. Nestled in the Horn of Africa, it boasts lush highlands, windswept plateaus, and the incomparable Great Rift Valley. Newcomers are captivated by its beauty, entranced by the golden sunsets against the Simien Mountains.\n\n[GetCountry('ETH').GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s enchanting tapestry weaves together diverse ethnic groups like the [ShowCultureName('amhara')], [ShowCultureName('afar_culture')], and [ShowCultureName('tigre')]. United by trials, [GetCountry('ETH').GetNameWithNoTooltip] remains resilient like an ancient baobab tree, enduring through time.\n\nInspired by these ancient origins, [GetCountry('ETH').GetNameWithNoTooltip] cherishes legendary unions like that of the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon. The legacy of their son Menelik, the first member of the [ShowDynastyName('solomonid_dynasty')] dynasty, echoes through the ages, connecting people of this land to the ancient Israelites.\n\nThrough the years, [GetCountry('ETH').GetNameWithNoTooltip]'s epic tale unfolds, shaped by destiny and the unwavering spirit of its people. Triumphs and tribulations weave a rich tapestry of life's ebb and flow.\n\nHowever, this nation is a realm encircled by adversaries who eagerly await any opportunity to strike. Managing not only to survive, but thrive, will be a challenge."

 country_history_EWY: "Nestled in the borderlands between [ShowAreaName('wales_area')] and the heartlands of the [GetCountry('ENG').GetLongName], the [GetCountry('EWY').GetLongName] holds a vital strategic position as one of the marcher lordships charged with securing the realm's western frontier.\n\nThe current ruler, [GetCharacter('eng_bartholomew_burghersh_the_elder').GetName], is a loyal servant of the Crown and a veteran of both war and courtly life. A trusted retainer of [GetCharacter('eng_edward_iii').GetShortName], he has proven himself not only on the battlefield, but also as a royal envoy and administrator, serving at times as Constable of [ShowLocationName('dover')] and Warden of the Cinque Ports. His landed authority in the Marches gives him both wealth and reach, though he remains ever vigilant against the shifting loyalties and ambitions that define the region.\n\nWill the [ShowDynastyName('burghersh_dynasty')] line maintain its favor with the [ShowDynastyNameWithNoTooltip('burghersh_dynasty')] and guard the Marches with honor? Or will the shifting tides of politics, war, and inheritance sweep away this marcher stronghold?"

 country_history_FLO: "The [GetCountry('FLO').GetAdjective] domain stands strong at the cusp of a new age! Our republic has stood the test of time and is located in a prime position to take advantage of our region's prosperity and affluence. Around us, rival states and potential allies all make their moves in a bid to influence and expand their territories in [ShowRegionName('italy_region')].\n\nHowever, few are as well known for their aptitude in arts and cultural influence as those in our forums of thought in [GetCountry('FLO').GetName]. Under the guidance of a capable administration and an educated population, the coming century will elevate our people and have us shine brightly as pioneering innovators during a time of great enlightenment. Provided we establish ourselves as such, of course..."

 country_history_FRA: "The death of [GetCharacter('fra_charles_iv_capet').GetShortName] without a male heir in 1328 marked the end of [ShowDynastyName('capet_dynasty')] rule over the [GetCountry('FRA').GetLongName], resulting in the coronation of [GetCharacter('fra_philip_vi_valois').GetName], a relative from a former cadet branch of the dynasty. However, this claim has been contested by [GetCharacter('eng_edward_iii').GetName] of [GetCountry('ENG').GetName], on the pretext that while the [ShowHeirSelectionName('salic_law')] of [GetCountry('FRA').GetNameWithNoTooltip] forbids the passing of the throne to a female successor, it does not forbid inheritance through a female line. As the son of [GetCharacter('eng_isabella_of_france').GetName], the last living sibling of [GetCharacter('fra_charles_iv_capet').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip], [GetCharacter('eng_edward_iii').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] might claim the throne of [GetCountry('FRA').GetNameWithNoTooltip] as his birthright.\n\nThe tension between both countries has worsened over the past years, as our hospitality of the exiled young ruler of [GetCountry('SCO').GetName], [GetCharacter('sco_david_ii').GetName], has enraged the [GetCountry('ENG').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] court, which supports the rival [GetCountry('SBL').GetName] claimant to the [GetCountry('SCO').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] throne. As a response, [GetCharacter('eng_edward_iii').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] has also recently granted refuge to [GetCharacter('eng_robert_iii_artois').GetName], who escaped calls to face trial in [ShowLocationName('paris')] for his attempts to seize the [GetCountry('ARS').GetLongName]. There are rumors that [GetCharacter('eng_robert_iii_artois').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] is even encouraging the disgruntled [GetCharacter('eng_edward_iii').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] to press his claim to the throne of [GetCountry('FRA').GetNameWithNoTooltip] militarily.\n\nShould relations reach a boiling point, [GetCharacter('fra_philip_vi_valois').GetShortNameWithNoTooltip] may require the support of [GetCharacter('fra_philip_vi_valois').GetHerHis] subjects, although more than one ambitious [ShowSubjectTypeName('appanage')] hailing from the old royal line may seize the opportunity to demand greater privileges, proving a greater threat to the stability of the crown than any invading claimant. The upcoming years will be consequential for the future of [GetCountry('FRA').GetNameWithNoTooltip], having to face external [GetCountry('ENG').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] menace and the proud [GetCountry('FRA').GetAdjectiveWithNoTooltip] lords at once. Will the country fall to the fake pretenders, or emerge as the main power in [ShowContinentName('europe')]?"

 country_history_GEN: "The city of [ShowLocationName('genoa')] stands out as the most important commercial port in the [ShowAreaName('western_mediterranean_sea_area')], its [GetCountry('GEN').GetGovernment.GetGovernmentType.GetName] having greatly expanded its influence overseas through trade and war.\n\nAfter defeating the [GetCountry('PIS').GetLongName], it gained the island of Corsica and established a foothold in [ShowAreaName('sardinia_area')].

 country_history_JAP_common: "After a long period of peace under the Kamakura Shogunate, the islands of Japan were plunged again into war during the [GetCountry('MGE').GetAdjective] invasions.

Our lands have always been a hub for exchange of ideas, cultures, and faiths, with [ShowReligionName('zoroastrian')], [ShowReligionGroupName('muslim')], [ShowReligionGroupName('christian')], and even [ShowReligionGroupName('buddhist')] people populating the nation.

Drinking from both sources, as well as from the presence of [ShowReligionName('hindu')] and [ShowReligionGroupName('buddhist')], the [ShowCultureNameWithNoTooltip('thai_culture')] developed its own unique identity, creating polities that are able to stand on equal footing to those by the former rulers, the [ShowCultureName('mon_culture')] people, who have seen their territory reduced and many of their old kingdoms supplanted by [ShowCultureNameWithNoTooltip('thai_culture')] ones. This has also caused the [GetCountry('KHM').GetLongName] to slip into decline, and they have subsequently lost much of its previous influence.

The indigenous religion of [ShowRegionName('tibet_region')], [ShowReligionName('bon')], has also absorbed many [ShowReligionGroupAdjectiveWithNoTooltip('buddhist')] elements, to the point that where foreign eyes could not discern a difference. As a result of our isolated development and native reframing of foreign ideals,  [ShowCultureGroupNameWithNoTooltip('tibetan_group')] identity is very distinct, and few foreigners have been able to subjugate us.
