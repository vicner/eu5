 #Scenario Descriptions

 #Economy
 HUN_scenario_desc: "With the disaffected nobles subdued with an iron fist by King Charles of Anjou, #W Hungary#! is once again a kingdom where its diverse population can cultivate its lands and exploit its rich minerals. This substantial tax base allows for the rapid expansion of industry and crafts, while the natural barrier of the Carpathian Mountains and a friendly diplomatic status with most of its neighbors foster peace and prosperity."
 HOL_scenario_desc: "The County of #W Holland#! is governed by Count William of Avesnes, who also rules the counties of Zeeland and Hainaut. Despite these diverse domains, Holland's location on the North Sea coast, halfway between the English Channel and the Baltic Sea, makes it a prime area for economic exchange and the development of a strong industry. If these opportunities are exploited, Holland could become a major economic power in the coming years."

 #Politics
 NOR_scenario_desc: "Being in Personal Union with Sweden, the Kingdom of #W Norway#! faces a new and challenging period. Along its fjords and valleys, the vast national resources, especially timber and fishing, could allow its people to enrich themselves. And with prosperous and content states, more intense diplomacy could be fostered with its neighbors in Scandinavia and the North Sea, allowing Norway to prosper again."
 NAP_scenario_desc: "Born from the ambitions of powerful dynasties seeking to dominate the lands of southern Italy, #W Naples#! is now ruled by King Robert of Anjou, a wise and just monarch, known for his sagacity and keen judgment. Its large and growing population provides a solid foundation for rapid internal expansion, based on agricultural wealth, which could support King Robert's efforts to make Naples the hegemon of Italy."

 #Military
 TUR_scenario_desc: "The #W Ottomans#! are consolidating their position as one of the most powerful #italic Beyliks#!, the Turkish warlords, on the rise, eager to secure vital territories along the Bosphorus coast and the Anatolian highlands. There have been some recent conquests along the border with Byzantium, which stands as the main enemy for the West to defeat. Gaining dominance over the neighboring #italic Beyliks#! would considerably increase the resources needed for future victories."
 CAS_scenario_desc: "King Alfonso XI, 'the Avenger', rules #W Castile#! without much internal opposition after establishing his dominance over the kingdom's nobility. He can now turn his attention south, where the Emirate of Granada survives as the last Islamic bastion in Iberia. His powerful ally, the Sultanate of Morocco, maintains a strategic position on the peninsula centered on Algeciras and Ronda, allowing it to intervene from across the Strait of Gibraltar."

 #Deprecated
 ARA_scenario_desc: "The Crown of Aragon stands proudly as a significant power in the Western Mediterranean region thanks to its maritime prowess, diplomatic weight, and flourishing trade networks, ready for further expansion."
 FLA_scenario_desc: "As one of the wealthiest countries in the Low Countries, thanks to the wealthy market center of Bruges, Flanders is well-positioned to navigate the complexities of diplomacy, benefiting from its position as a middleman."
 VEN_scenario_desc: "The Most Serene Republic of Venice is the most important and powerful of the merchant republics of the Mediterranean Sea and controls important commercial ports and islands all across it."
 FRA_scenario_desc: "The coronation of King Philip VI has been contested by King Edward III of England, and he now has to deal simultaneously with the external threat from England and the proud French lords, which poses an existential threat to France."
